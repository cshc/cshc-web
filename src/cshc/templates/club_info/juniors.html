      Cambridge South Hockey Club’s junior section trains weekly during the hockey season between September and March, with the younger groups 
      on Saturday mornings and older groups on Wednesday evenings. Training sessions are led by professional coaches assisted by club player-coaches.
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
    The sessions are for boys and girls, aimed at players from year 2 to year 9 (ages 6 to 14). Training is based around the 
    <a href="http://www.playquicksticks.co.uk" target="_blank"/>‘Quicksticks’</a> (for younger children) and 
    <a href="http://www.englandhockey.co.uk/page.asp?section=2386&sectionTitle=In2Hockey" target="_blank">In2Hockey</a> (for older players) forms of the game played in schools. The 
    junior sessions are focused on teaching and developing basic skills and team play, ultimately providing a pathway towards 
    senior team hockey. Junior players can start to train and play with the <a href="{{ training }}" title="Seniors Training">club’s senior teams</a>, 
    alongside their age-group based hockey, from age 13 upwards.
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
    We offer a <strong>free 3 session taster</strong> for new players to try out without commitment. The subscription fee is due your fourth 
    session - if you decide not to continue beyond your first 3 sessions there is nothing to pay!
