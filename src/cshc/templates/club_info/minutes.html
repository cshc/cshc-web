<p class="lead">
    CSHC is a not-for-profit organisation run by its own members in accordance with the club Constitution. Prior to 
    the 2009/10 season the Men's and Ladies' clubs were seperate entities but since then the two have merged and a 
    single Committee now administers the club, with sub-committees for men's and ladies' playing matters. The Committee 
    is appointed at the Annual General Meeting and appointments run for a single season.
