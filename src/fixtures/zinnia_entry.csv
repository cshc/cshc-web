Only at the CSHC Halloween Social!</p>";"halloween-2014";"<p><p>Following a mixed day of hockey, with some big wins and losses by our teams, many of us were looking forward to winding down, by dressing up in clothes we don't usually wear, wearing lots of make-up, and having a few burly beers and shorts (many of us through straws...). It was of course the halloween bandeoke event organised by our friends at Cantabs!</p><p>The Cantabs clubhouse was bustling with people smiling, laughing and enjoying themselves. One of the things that hit me when I walked in was just how much of an effort had been made by everyone. I don't think there was one person who hadn't tried - and those that made less effort than others were made to pay with a dirty pint (note to self: always make an effort). The band was on form and engaged with the party atmosphere, to the extent that I couldnt tell who was a guest and who was a member of the band with so many people up on stage. The bandeoke singers were surprisingly good as well! There is always that person(s) who struggles to quite hit the high (or any) notes, but boy do they make you laugh while doing it. Good effort by all the singers and thank you for contributing to the nights entertainment.</p><p>By the end of the Bandeoke, all that was required was sorting out the travel arrangements to the fairly well known local club called Lola's (although I've never been there... ;-) After some confusion with taxis and just missing the guest list cut off time, we were left contemplating paying £9 each to get in. This was until Shin came and saved the day with his very unselfish \"I'll pay for the table\" philosophy, which went down extremely well with the group that travelled to the club. Good man Shin.</p><p>The night in the club was great fun, with a mix of dancing, drinking (surprise, surprise) and me being mistaken for a \"seat stealer\" and nearly being man-handled away from the table I was protecting after Emma and the girls became concerned about two shady looking individuals sitting next to the handbags. We were all getting some funny looks from other people that night, and I think there may of been one of two people in there with clown phobias.</p><p>On the whole, this was a very good night, which was most enjoyable for everyone who attended. Unfortunately the event was over-subscribed, so we will have to take this into account going forward so that we can provide a space for everyone who wants to attend in future. As future events will also have this problem, please book your tickets early!</p><br></p>";NULL;NULL;"2014-12-28 23:08:27";"2";"1";"0";;"entry_detail.html";"0";"0";"0";"0";"1";"zinnia/_entry_detail.html"

Sadly for Sneadey, he was responsible for both.</p><hr><p>Cambridge South hosted their very first Fancy Dress Christmas Extravaganza on Saturday, blowing away the cobwebs with an intra-club mixed game at Long Road.</p><p>The forecast for heavy rain did not deter the hardy Southeners, with some not only braving the conditions but also chosing to do so in the skimpiest of costumes (Jelley, Neil, Kim et al.) After a few minutes of costume comparison and a fortifying Bucks Fizz all-round, the game could begin, with Team Christmas facing off against the motley bunch of assorted others (Team Non-Christmas, or ‘NC’).</p><p>It was the hotchpotch XI (or XIII) that started the brighter, with Superman appearing particularly motivated, especially once he’d jettisoned the cape. He and the Fairy combined to open the scoring before the Knight and Noddy (dubiously appearing under the ‘Christmas’ label) crafted an instant equaliser.</p><p>Once their true identities had been discovered, it was also something of a selection quirk that Hansel and Gretel had been separated but they were both making an impact – Hansel by testing the saturation of the new pitch by choosing to lay flat on it (a move later copied by the speeding cow) whilst Gretel was calmly controlling the NC defence.</p><p>As the first period went on, NC’s grip on the game increased. Team Christmas seemed determined to hold possession within the defence, despite the fact that at least one of their defenders was prevented by his outfit from seeing the ball. With Scantily Clad Cricket Girl and Weird Leeds Uni Student Girl pressurising high up the pitch, several goals followed in quick succession and a coquettish Santa (having netted a truly marvellous OG) wisely decided to blow for an early half-time.</p><p>The second half followed a similar pattern, with the author’s personal highlight being a flapping Turkey’s reverse-stick save from Wetsuit-man. A splendid display of Christmas spirit saw the game miraculously finishing with a ‘next goal wins’ show-down (despite the fact that Team NC were at least a few goals up under the standard scoring system – i.e. counting the goals actually scored). Hence, there were a couple of grumbles in the Panton afterwards when Christmas Pudding-head duly swept in a well-worked, last ditch ‘winner’.</p><p>With the game now finished, the rain duly ended and we could all cycle to the pub in relative comfort for lashings of onions with a couple of minor carbohydrate accompaniments.</p>";NULL;NULL;"2015-01-05 21:24:32";"5";"1";"0";;"entry_detail.html";"0";"0";"0";"0";"1";"zinnia/_entry_detail.html"

Can the club surpass last season's successes ? Doubt is not an option. We will need the training (Mondays 7pm-9pm from Sept 9th ) currently being schemed by Jack Chalk and our expert coaches (thanks again chaps for committing to CSouth once again), a few pre-season fixtures (thanks to fixtures secretary George Wych), and the inspiration of our cadre of captains. Here are their recipes for glory for 2013 - 2014:</p><h3>Ladies 1sts - East League 3NW(S)&nbsp;<small>(last season....4th in Camb Prem)</small></h3><p>The L1s would like win more matches, finish higher in the league table and maybe even go for promotion..We're going to play some beautiful hockey, with lots of passing and movement.We will support Cath and the L2s and hope to get two good, strong teams out every week&nbsp;<em><strong>(Kylie Beasley / Louise Tonkin)</strong></em></p><h3>Ladies 2nds - East League 4NW(S)&nbsp;<small>(last season ...8th in Camb Div 1)</small></h3><p>The 2s would like to build on last season. We want to enjoy playing (on and off the pitch), score plenty of goals and most importantly, aim to beat City - again! We will be considering formations such as the 'Flying V' and other Mighty Ducks tactics so watch this space…&nbsp;<em><strong>(Cath Anthony / Louise Gutteridge)</strong></em></p><h3>Mens 1sts - Eastern League 3NW&nbsp;<small>(last season... 3rd in East 3NW)</small></h3><p>The obvious target for the men's 1st team is to top last season's 'best ever' year, if we can achieve that, promotion may be the likely reward! The focus week to week however will be much shorter term, win the game! Pass the ball and be decisive when in possession and when the other fellas have it, get it back! There's a great team spirit and nothing to fear, this could be our year!.&nbsp;<em><strong>(Mark Williams)</strong></em></p><h3>Mens 2nds - Eastern League 3NW&nbsp;<small>(last season...10th in East 3NW)</small></h3><p>2s' aim is to improve our best ever result in Div 3, gain 28 points and hit 6th place. More importantly, we will aim to enjoy ourselves every week and play the best hockey we can during each game.&nbsp;<em><strong>(Ron Oren / Nick Venner)</strong></em></p><h3>Mens 3rd Team - Eastern League 4W&nbsp;<small>(last season...3rd in East 5NW)</small></h3><p>Cambridge South 3s, aka \"The Cambridge Globetrotters\", will be looking to consolidate on back to back promotions with a solid mid table finish this season. We have an extensive tour of thrilling Lincolnshire towns and attractions planned, taking in such thrills as one of the tallest TV masts in Europe (Louth), the famous bulb museum (Spalding) and who can forget the Little Chef near Boston (although we will only be passing through this year(3 times)). We will be looking to play the same flowing attacking hockey combined with hard tackling and structured defence that has been the trademark of the 3s for the last 2 years.&nbsp;<em><strong>(Alistair Edge / John Benedikz)</strong></em></p><h3>Mens 4th Team - Eastern League 6NW(s)&nbsp;<small>(Last season...6th in 6NW(s))</small></h3><p>The targets are:</p><ol><li>To get a team out each week, and have fun in the process.</li><li>Get good attendance at CSHC events from the 4’s.</li><li>Win the league (as long as City don't field a ridiculously strong team which is highly likely)</li></ol><p>The Team will play..hopefully together, playing hockey similar to how the Brazilians play football – glorious and angelic with a pinch of flair. Although a Dave ‘super-smash’ 16 down the middle from defence will suffice for now. We will be for being the most successful team and the most ‘fun/friendly’ team. The team which people one day will go “damn…..I wish I had played for that team”&nbsp;<em><strong>(Joe Whittaker / Boris Lossy)</strong></em></p><h3>Mens 5th Team - Eastern League 6NW(s)</h3><p>For the inaugural season, the M5s aims are to put out a full 11 each week and keep the number of double-ups to a minimum. We also want to provide a platform for players new to the club (and possibly the game) to get a taste of competitive hockey in Cambridge and progress to other teams within the club, while also giving a run out to those players who enjoy spending their saturday's chasing grown men with a stick without fear of falling foul of the local constabulary (dodgy tackles notwithstanding).&nbsp;<em><strong>(Simon Frampton)</strong></em></p><p>..in addition there is a rumour that the CSouth Mixed team will be re-invented, under the leadership of&nbsp;<strong>Alice Hug and Nick Venner</strong>.

The going is getting tougher with a couple of away defeats after 6 straight wins (and 41 goals !) extended the record winning streak from last season.

If we can play every game like we did our best matches of last season, I'll be happy. This year I'd like to see us working really well together as a team (even if its not the same people every week!), with lots of passing, and lots of excellent plays in groups of 2 and 3 up the field. The most important thing for us is increasing our chances in attack, and keeping the ball up front. This means people need to run into good space to receive the ball, and and be confident in passing it to each other in the goal and the attacking 25. We may not win every game, but as long as we are a hard team to beat every week, that's o.k. This season, finishing mid-table would be great, anything higher is definitely possible, and would be awesome. (Serin Dabb / Louise Cantwell)</p><h3>Ladies' 2nds - Camb Div 1 (Last season ...5th in Camb Div 1; highest ever)</h3><p>We aim to get full teams out each week ideally with subs, bringing together experience and introducing new players into the club. We need to work together as a team with good communication, accurate passing and making the most of our strong breaks to score more goals. Playing needs to be fun yet challenging. Hopefully this will enable us to push for a strong position in Cambs Div 1. ( Leonie Dickman / Gemma Young)</p><h3>Men's 1sts - Eastern League 3NW (Last season... 4th in East 3NW = highest ever)</h3><p>Having finished 4th in Div 3 for the last two years, the Men's 1sts are once again aiming for promotion to the elusive heights of Div 2. The main strength of our team has tended to be a solid defence - so with the loss of two key defenders from last year, our ability to reform as a cohesive defensive unit will be crucial this coming season. The integration of some exciting new faces into the squad will certainly mean competition for places remains stiff. A core aim for the year will be to improve our passing, while not losing our direct attacking style. (Graham McCulloch / Mark Williams)</p><h3>Men's 2nds - Eastern League 3NW (last season....9th in East 3 NW: highest ever)</h3><p>M2s will redouble their efforts to conquer the mid-table of Div3, overwhelming our opponents with the flowing champagne-hockey we've come to expect from the team. With some fresh new faces to support the old guard, the team is well set to repeat last year's successes and improve on some disappointing results. Most hotly anticipated are the double trashing that we intend to give City and - of course - the fight with M1s. Our aim for the season is to finish in the top half of the table - 6th or better.

Where is my dedicated preparation and hydration time? After winning the inaugural club day event I felt it was my time to shine again. Three tournaments is a long time to go without a trophy. I could also definitely show everyone that it is me not Craig who provide the flare to the men's ones. To do this I decided to show everyone that hockey is not the only sport where I excel so I brought a football to have a little kick about before hand. Unfortunately while attempting one of my normally perfect trick shots the ball rebounded off the cross bar and hit me in the face! Someone must of moved the goal a few millimeters out of place. As I was suffering from probable concussion, my team struggled on without my skills and leadership. Simon Cooper even went as far as letting the ball past him to an attacker right in front of the goal as he did not think they could catch up with a ball rolling towards them... In my dazed state there was little I could do until the final game when the world just about stopped spinning. We were awesome and spanked the cocky Reds 3-1.</p><p></p><p>What did I learn from this? Hockey is a much better sport than football, male parrots have periods (thank you Dr Capt Hurford-Whitehead) and all I really want is a hug.</p><hr><p></p><h3>Highlights from The NHS Tourists (Team Yellow)</h3><p></p><p><i><b>Team</b>:&nbsp;Paresh Parsot (c), Chris Richardson, Dom Nelson, Esmé Veldhuizen, Hannah Kenyon, Laura Ludlow, Namoi Penfold, Naomi Wake, Simon Frampton, Alan Radford</i></p><p></p><p>The most organised team, with each player being issued a play-book with three different formations to adopt depending on the current game situation, score line and transverse of Neptune. After Jack nicked the schedule (as he works in the public sector so could not afford to print one of his own), things did end up as a free-for-all. Hannah, Esme and Alan's total hockey looked impressive with seamless changes in position. Dom's awesome goal line saves were spectacular - hopefully he has not been injured and can still play this Saturday. Captain Paresh became so engrossed in watching and taking notes on a rival team that he forgot to bring himself on in one of his own games.</p><blockquote>\"But the important thing in Club Day is not to triumph but to compete…not victory but combat…not to have vanquished but to have fought well…not winning but taking part.\" - Parsot 2015, captain of the second from bottom NHS Tourists.</blockquote><hr><h3>Highlights from The Prancing Ponies (Team Pink)</h3><p><i><b>Team</b>: Kim Cooil (c), Adrian Dudd, Bex Baker, Douglas Gibson, Howard Steed, Laura Edge, Laurie Haslop,Lottie Alves, Saskia Molekamp, Wilco Dijkstra</i></p><p>The first quite literal highlight was giving out the day glow war paint and watching Wilco paint his entire face a pink so luminous he could of passed as the fourth flamingo.</p><p>With Kimbo bossing the midfield and Adrian mopping up at the back the Ponies managed to take all 3 points off the McScotts, ending their title challenge.</p><p>Other games were eventful for the utter humiliation of the men's 1st team squad. From watching Pearson spend most of the pink/blue game rolling round on the floor to watching Paresh getting absolutely sold by a dummy and skinned by a girl (who cannot be named), leaving him also lying in a heap on the floor only to recover just in time to get a stick behind but fail to stop the worlds slowest miss-hit pea-roller from trickling into the goal. He then subbed himself off head bent low in shame.</p><hr><h3>Highlights from Long Ranged Shooting (Team Red)</h3><p><i><b>Team</b>:&nbsp;Joe Whittaker (c), Charlotte Moss, Eimear Lee, Jack Robertson, Janette Murphy, Jimmy Hockley, Katharine Hill, Owen Vaughan, Simon Jelley, Sophie McComish&nbsp;</i></p><p>So near yet so far. We were the long term leaders, the people's choice to lift the trophy but alas fate intervened and we ended up in a distant 3rd place on goal difference. Critical losses to the Blacks and Blues cost us in the end. We started so well with 5 players present at 7:30 for a seven aside tournament. Luckily we were not on first and Owen sprinted into view and Jack R leisurely strolled onto the pitch just as the whistle blew for our first game. What a start! 7 goals scored in our first two games with tournament top scorer Sophie leading the line. Scoring a hat-trick is hard enough in 70 minutes let alone 9! The wheels however eventually fell off. After we ended the Oranges title challenge we slipped up against the Black team. With nothing left to play for we even lost to the Blues. Goal difference was still being calculated when we left but I am confident our free scoring style would have won through in the end.</p><hr><h3>Highlights from Real Scotts have Mc in their Name (Team Orange)</h3><p><i><b>Team</b>:&nbsp;Emma Farlie (c), Ali Edge, Colin Troll, Ian Marshman, Jason Mann, Jessica Robins, Lauren Brown, Liz Faulkner, Shin Kim, Iona Walker</i></p><ul><li>Colin playin' by th' rules o' na ariels instead th' birl (or whitevur he is cawin it!) alang th' back line!</li><li>Jess' epic defending skills but managing tae support th' enemy #whosaforward?</li><li>Emma's tripping up Laurie Haslop fur bein' a jobby social sec!</li><li>Ali 'n' Ian's braw take the motor thro' th' centur ploughing intae anythin' that git in th' way!</li><li>Jason saving goalie pure class think he forgot aboot th' padding</li><li>Shin......

Subsequent reports suggest the fodder was excellent and at least comparable to the Chairman’s description of some of the teas he has enjoyed throughout the year.</p><p>Is it 9 o’clock already? Well, then it’s time for the speeches to begin and, thankfully, Sneadey has sourced a PA system of dubious provenance for a bargain £1.50.</p><p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/11061233_10205824168436064_817802500139905458_o.jpg\" style=\"\"></p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/11155000_10205824169316086_6011083755332258388_o.jpg\" style=\"\"></p></p><p>The Captain’s speeches were, for the most part, mercifully short and each and every award winner given a rousing reception (details to follow via an official Club post shortly).</p><p>So, that just about rounds up the evening. Apart from some shots. And a boat race? And Fez Club?</p><p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/11149699_10205824170796123_7475818465513697966_o.jpg\" style=\"\"></p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/11187264_10205824172916176_5631831568515479082_o.jpg\" style=\"\"></p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/11188330_10101259924198970_8551873138780815915_n.jpg\" style=\"\"></p></p><h3>The Aftermath</h3><p>It is morning. My face feels like several students have spent a term studying geography in it. I smell like compost. Photos appear on Facebook but thankfully I am in few of them. I recall little of the previous evening but still have a wide smile on my face. Can I go to Alford?</p><br><p></p>";NULL;NULL;"2015-05-06 10:52:44";"15";"1";"0";;"entry_detail.html";"0";"0";"0";"0";"1";"zinnia/_entry_detail.html"

Not only was this the first year South had entered two teams in the tournament (effectively doubling our chances of carrying away the Wooden Spoon), but someone had actually brought some <i>healthy fruit</i> to snack on, in addition to the bulging bags of scotch eggs, Pringles, ice lollies and chocolate. Rest assured - the health-nut was swiftly reprimanded and schooled on the Core Principles of the Ely Hockey Tournament*</p><p></p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/untitled-1736.jpg\" style=\"\"></p><p></p><p>All too hurriedly South Heroes and South Villains took the the hockey pitches, resplendent in red and green capes respectively. And all too hurriedly we discovered that capes and hockey sticks <i>do not play well together</i>. Whilst a dashing red cape may do wonders for one's self esteem and looks fabulous in action photos, it does rather inhibit any type of competent hockey...</p><p></p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/untitled-1728.jpg\" style=\"\"></p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/untitled-1716.jpg\" style=\"\"></p><p>Despite that, both teams performed admirably on the Saturday, with the Heroes taking advantage of actually having a goal-keeper to win 4 of their 5 matches. Club veterans combined with newcomers and even a cheeky ringer from Oxford to take on the random assortment of opposition teams. For the Villains, Simon F rounded off some delightfully flowing attacks with a couple of exquisite finishes. And for the Heroes, Graham rounded off some equally delightful flowing attacks with a mixture of miss-hits, air-balls, stumbles and general cape-related-incompetence that almost made it look like he hadn't played hockey in over a year. The Heroes match against City was 'memorable' as always, with Chris P dribbling one-handed past most of their team to score the first goal and Naomi almost starting a brawl with her brazen goal celebration of running off with the (drunk and abusive) opposition defender's can of beer and pouring it away at the side of the pitch.&nbsp;<br></p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/untitled-1741.jpg\" style=\"\"></p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/untitled-1756.jpg\" style=\"\"></p><p></p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45em; background-color: initial;\">After a full day in the unexpected sunshine, everyone's faces were starting to match the red capes. More beers were drunk, more burgers were eaten and more banter was... bantered. The lightweights headed off in dribs and drabs to the comfort of their homes for the night, while the hardcore remained. Evening villainous/heroic costumes were donned. Drinking games in The Palace (fast becoming an excellent South tradition) was followed by the usual clubhouse dancing. Of particular note:</span><br></p><p></p><ul><li><span style=\"line-height: 1.45em; background-color: initial;\">Chris P ignoring the clear '<b>Avoid contact with skin</b>' warning on his can of silver acrylic paint to completely cover himself in spray paint (and then an entire can of Lynx deodorant in a futile attempt to mask the paint fumes).</span><br></li><li><span style=\"line-height: 1.45em; background-color: initial;\">Shin dressing in an all-in-one Pikachu outfit, which ended up round his ankles for a (sadly) memorable rendition of Gangnam Style on the dance floor. Rather than slum it in a tent, Shin had booked into a nearby hotel for the night. Its still not clear what the hotel staff made of a very inebriated Pikachu turning up in a taxi at 1:30am claiming to have booked a room for the night!</span><br></li><li><span style=\"line-height: 1.45em; background-color: initial;\">Matt K as Daredevil. The man has the energy of a three-year-old and loves to dance! Who knew?!&nbsp;</span><br></li><li><span style=\"line-height: 1.45em; background-color: initial;\">Serin coining her new motto: \"Dance like there are people around to catch you\".</span></li></ul><p></p><p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/IMG_1305.JPG\" style=\"\"></p><p></p></p><p>Sunday was all about playing just well enough that we didn't embarrass ourselves (quite a hard task) but not too well that we ended up having to stay for the final (a much easier task as it turned out). And eating more burgers - obviously. &nbsp;</p><p>So if you weren't there let me just say this. You missed out! And you should definitely join the fun next year!</p><p>* Beer, Burgers, Casual Hockey... and Beer</p><br><p></p>";NULL;NULL;"2015-05-19 11:28:23";"16";"1";"0";;"entry_detail.html";"0";"0";"0";"0";"1";"zinnia/_entry_detail.html"

Tick... knock knock. Knock knock knock. Tick. I am dreaming. No, I am awake. Someone is throwing small stones on my window and knocking on the front door. It's 7 am! I look outside and it's my mate Lars, but why is he outside at 7 am? What happened last night? Ah yes, my testimonial - that special South send off that lasted the entire day and well into the night...</p><p>It started with a hockey match, of course. It was really like most of the games for the M3s this season and, I think, most of the other South teams. At the beginning of the week I had about 18 players in my squad, but then the multi-faceted lives of the Cambridge South hockey player started kicking in: \"I have to go to an unexpected event in London\", \"I think the shrimps in the wedding buffet last night were bad\", and right up to push-back, \"my wife's got an ear infection and I have to take her to the hospital\", \"I'll be a bit late\", and so on.&nbsp;</p><p>5 minutes before push-back I am looking at 5-6 players (Jason Mann, Joe Whittaker, Douglas Gibson, James Mathews - with one t -, Tom Roselli), but as I said, normal stuff, so I am totally cool about it, happily ignoring the opposition's banter (\"Where is your team Ras?\"). I put a green shirt on one of the opposition players without the other captain noticing. Brynjolffsson, the M3s captain-to-be, walks around the corner, then the doc aka Ian Marshman. Ah, and there is Neil Sneade. A minute later David Bridge walks in, he lives nearby. And we can start playing with 10 players.&nbsp;</p><p>We are under a lot of pressure in the beginning of the game, but a few minutes later the Moncks, literally all of them, start trickling into Long Road and onto the pitch: Nathan Monck is first, and he quickly helps make the teams more even. A bit later Dave Monck arrives, and when he is subbed on he makes a cracking impact. First he sends Sophie McComish's stick flying in our own D with a crunching tackle, then moments later we get a short. And before I get to tell him that the rule is that I am the only one that can take first strike, he has reverse sticked the ball into Colin Troll's thigh, and he has to sit out for a while. The umpires seem quite please with the many opportunities to practice the new green card 2 minute suspension routine. Ky Ho has arrives and subs on for David Bridge. &nbsp;</p><p>With a full team, we start making some effective counter attacks. After one attacking move down the left the resulting shot is saved by Loopy, but I am able to pick up the rebound and roll the ball calmly into the bottom left corner. The celebrations are less calm, a goal in my last game for South! The important thing is of course, as always, that my team is now in the lead.&nbsp;</p><p>At half time I present the organic carrots that my mum has sent over for the last game, and we discuss the cracking tackles we have made so far while munching away.</p><p>In the second half, the fitness and skill levels of the M1 and L1 players start to kick in. Add to that, the increased distraction banter from Kimberly Coil, insistence on more passes from L1 captain Georgie Hurford (\"Jack\" &gt; \"Jaaack!\" &gt; \"Jaaaaaaccck!!!\" &gt; \"pass!!!!!\"), Shin Kim exchanging his right back position with left wing Wilco Dijkstra through some clever dialogue, and recently returned world traveller Graham McCulloch pushing forward. Luckily we have the M1 goal keeper Jason Mann to redirect most of their efforts. Sophie sends a short corner just around the post. Jack Chalk gets a touch on a pass into the D, through his own legs, and flicks it just past the post as well. And then Sophie gets a goal from a short corner - even Dave Monck was a bit jealous there I think. We had it coming.</p><p>We hold them to a draw till the final whistle and it is now down to a 10 second penalties from the 25 yard line. I go first and that is when I come up with the Danish Dummy Roll - no doubt a technique that will live for many years with Cambridge South: you first pretend to go right, then pull the ball back left deep into the D, and then from a narrow angle you pretend to reverse stick the ball towards goal, only to miss on purpose, make a roll forward, and then casually push the ball into the goal just before time runs out. Jack Chalk scores confidently, but with a rather boring move if you don't mind me saying. Nathan Monck then unfortunately gets outsmarted by Loopy. Jason Mann sends Sophie flying on the yellow's second penalty, and he then saves the penalty flick - good man! Joe Whittaker cooly stays on his feet and puts away his penalty, 2-1! The yellows miss their last penalty and it's a win, what a game! Check the video below for some clips. Thanks to everyone who played, umpired, and special thanks to Jack Chalk for being the driving force in organising the whole thing.&nbsp;</p><p>We go to teas at the Tally Ho, everybody chatting, some playing pool, and it is really all good fun as per usual. Shin, my mate Lars, and I go straight to the Grain Store after teas. Everybody else trickles in, just as for the game, and around 10 pm, after loads of chatting, drinks, everybody eating in turns, and Shin being provoked to buying a bottle of champagne (a girl said she would have one more drink if it was champagne), I give the following succinct speech summing up everybody and everything at Cambridge South:&nbsp;</p><p>\"For a group of mainly British people, you guys are actually quite alright!\".</p><p>After the Grain Store the people still around walk into town and we hear some music from the Cambridge University Social Club. We walk in and there is some big salsa event on. 2 seconds later my mate Lars is dancing with some random girl. Apparently he kept dancing till 7 am, crazy Danish person!&nbsp;</p><p>Hope to see you guys soon!</p><p>Ras xx&nbsp;</p><p>PS all settled in, in Lisbon.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D6eawO2blh4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><br></p>";NULL;NULL;"2015-06-19 08:02:12";"18";"1";"0";;"entry_detail.html";"0";"0";"0";"0";"1";"zinnia/_entry_detail.html"

Eventually the ball went into the goal.</p><p>Halftime: 2-1. Veterinarian Ahmed tended to the wounded Animals. Mystic Steve and Christmas Jeanette gave words of encouragement. More orange juice was had!</p><p>The Animals had a stronger start to the second half, with the trio of Duracell Bunny Dave (Aston), Zebra James and Sheep Graham creating more chances and short corners, leading to Emma-Rose grabbing a goal and another followed soon after. Tinsel Jason got caught up on the random decorations he'd acquired over the festive period!</p><p>The Humans were not finished yet though!

Our team captains have engaged brains and come up with their cunning plans for glorious success...</p><h3>Mens 1sts (Jim Hockley, Stuart Rimmer) <small>Last Season 4th in Div 3NW</small></h3><p>\"With a solid 4th place finish in the previous (2014-2015) season, Cambridge South Men's 1st team are looking to step up and hit the promotion sweet spot this year. Strong continuity in the team, a dynamic new formation and an influx of talented new players into the club, mean that this year is shaping up to be our strongest yet. A fantastic first win (4-0) against an experienced Cambridge Vets side is a sign of good things to come. I've got a feeling it's going to be a hard-fought but enjoyable season for the M1s and we're looking forward to the challenge!\"</p><h3>Ladies 1sts (Diane Eichelsheim, Georgie Hurford) <small>Last Season 2nd in Div 3NW(S)</small></h3><p>We'd like to see this season that the L1s are working as a team together, that we enjoy the matches we play, and if possible (we think it is) to get the promotion at the end of the season. We'll be playing the 5-3-2 formation again, as it worked well for us last year.&nbsp;</p><h3>Mens 2nds (Simon Cooper, Tom Anns ) <small>Last Season 6th in Div 4NW</small></h3><p>I seem to have assembled another motley bunch of likely lads for this year's assault on the upper reaches of Div 4NW. No new tactical masterplan is required, as the remaining teams in the Club are steadily adopting ours. My main challenges will be to get Tom Anns out of the toilet and to keep Matt Kern out of The Fez Club. We've largely kept the structurally suspect core from last year, to which I'm hopeful we've added a spot of youthful flair and enthusiasm over the summer. We start with an away trip to those friendly folk from Cambridge City (which we won - Editor). Bring it.</p><h3>Ladies 2nds (Lottie Alves, Hannah Kenyon) <small>Last Season 12th in Div 3NW(S)</small></h3><p>Last season was tough for the L2s as we were playing in a hard league with some very strong teams. After moving down a league we're hoping to be in a much stronger position for the coming season. Our main goals for this season are to grow as a team, learning to play together, score some goals and win some matches. We may not come top of the league, but I want us to go into every match thinking that this could be our season, as we have great players who, with a bit of practice together will make us tough opponents!</p><h3>Mens 3rds (Jan Brynjolfsfsen, Douglas Gibson) <small>Last Season 4th in Div 5NW</small></h3><p>First and foremost, the M3s want to enjoy our Saturdays. We will do this by looking to play hockey in the ‘right’ way. ‘Right’ in the sense of having high trust in our own and our teammates abilities, and confidence that we are skilful enough to keep the ball on our sticks for that extra second needed for the right passes to appear. We will look to play with structure and teamwork, rather than relying on flashes of individual brilliance. If we do all that, then the having fun bit will be sorted as we will be winning lots of games!</p><h3>Ladies 3rds (Louise Gutteridge, Charlotte Moss) <small>Last Season 11th in Div 4NW(S)</small></h3><p>We want to welcome tonnes of new ladies into the club; Have fun and support each other; Not come last in the league. We will achieve this by:</p><p>Keeping it simple - focusing on good positioning and basic skills</p><p>Ensuring that everyone comes for a drink after the match to strengthen teams bonds</p><h3>Mens 4ths (John Greaves, Howard Steed) <small>Last season 10th in Div 5NW</small></h3><p>After last season's struggles we are looking forward to further character-building educational experiences around the east of England. We aim to introduce newcomers to the joys of (probably) the most friendly hockey club in the world, and hone their skills. We aim to enjoy playing hockey together, surprise the opposition and ourselves with our commitment and blend of the skills of youth and the speed of the aged (did I get that the right way around ?). And win some games.</p><h3>Mixed team (Sophie McComish, Colin Troll)</h3><p>We will try and beat the stats from last season (P5 W1 D2 L2) . The main objective is to have fun, and win a few games. We plan to adopt the men's 1st team 1-2-3-2-3-2-3 formation thingy. We want to continue on from the hard work by Diane and Neil last season and try and get as many club members to take part; the main emphasis is the social aspect between players from all of our teams in the club, also helping in people's development for their own teams.

However, due to Cambridge South Hockey Club having such brilliant members there were enough willing volunteers for the game that we were able to stage an in-house captain v captain match between Colin and Sophie.</p><p>We picked the teams one player at a time. My first selection was of course my wing man (and forever dependable) Tom Rossellini (the auto spell kicking in), and by the end of the selection process the team lists all looked very even. Pearson was a late volunteer, and in fear of tipping the balance if placed on either side he was shoved in goal where there was a vacancy.</p><p>So everyone arrived and it was obvious who was on whos side as everyone had remembered to bring the right coloured shirt (except Dan Loy who not only turned up late but managed to find a yucky light brown colour shirt which was exactly in the middle of light and dark). This was good as I had forgotten who was on my team. Sophie had 10 players and I had 12. In an act of kindness I offered Sophie one of my players. The term ‘give an inch take a mile’ springs to mind as she went straight to my talisman Rossellini and asked him to betray me. I was expecting Tom to say ‘No I’m playing for Colin’, but the actual reply was “I’ll just go get my white shirt’. The fact he came to the pitch with a white shirt makes me very suspicious of some pre-meditated collusion.</p><p>The game got going and the white team (Sophie’s team) were putting the pressure on the dark team (led by Tom amongst others – typical). The dark team managed to repel this but eventually succumbed to the mighty Graham scoring. The first half went very quickly apart from Graham stealing the show for the right, and the wrong reasons (he also received a green card for a ruthless stick tackle).</p><p>The second half was much more dramatic. The dark team levelled by Jack performing his composed trickery in the D and slotting home making it 1 a piece. The whites responded and put the pressure on again and won some short corners. I recall Pearson telling me he was about to throw up every time I stood next to him for the shorts, and also that he was bored in goal. He got so bored he abandoned the goal, took his pads off and re-appeared in the forward line. This act of craziness seemed like a good idea to start with as he scored a goal to make it 2-1 to the darks, however the whites bounced back and scored twice into an goalie-less goal, Graham and Dan getting the next two making it 3-2 to the whites.</p><p>There was further mischievous from my co-captain that wasn’t spotted until some point through the second half. She had snuck on their substitute, except there was no ‘substitution', they had been playing the entire 2nd half with 12 players on the pitch. Perhaps she thought we had the gale force wind as our 12th player or something?!? It was very evenly matched so I won’t make too big a deal out of this.</p><p>The dark team equalised again through a short corner, making it 3-3 with only a few minutes to go.</p><p>Guy should receive a special mention at this point for his lone umpiring, spending the match running up and down the pitch, and remaining impartial despite a family member on the pitch. He demonstrated this by giving his daughter Jess a yellow card for a brutal tackle.</p><p>The game was tied at the final whistle. This was not a desired result as we wanted the Mixed team to have another victory on that well run South website stats page, so the game was settled with penalty flicks. Sophie won this (and that is as much a mention as it's going to get).</p><p>Thanks to everyone who took part in a close match, which I hope everyone enjoyed. The pizzas afterwards were as good as usual, and kept everyone quiet for a few minutes whilst I sorted out the paperwork (just collecting the match fees really);</p><br></p>";NULL;NULL;"2015-11-30 22:47:25";"29";"1";"0";;"entry_detail.html";"0";"0";"0";"0";"1";"zinnia/_entry_detail.html"

Different approaches were taken to the idea of a fancy-dress, dynamic warm-up…</p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/12510334_10154450917675476_6768920281271369189_n.jpg\" style=\"\"></p><p><br></p><p></p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/12400460_10154450916975476_8260377249248445646_n.jpg\" style=\"\"></p><br><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/12417703_10154450917520476_2985495213631549654_n.jpg\" style=\"\"></p><br><p>During that time, the selection of two evenly-matched sides was settled on and so it was that Team Human faced off against Team Animal(/inHuman).</p><p>It was the latter that made the early running, helped by the early loss of Cricketer Man to a recurring knee complaint. Luckily, he could call on Yorkshire’s finest, Sir Geoff Boycott, to help out and he shored up the Human defence with his trusty stick of rhubarb and his Nan’s judgement outside off-stump.</p><p>Recognising that something drastic was required, the birthday Wizard waved his magic wand (Editor’s Note: Later identified by the bearer as a staff) and conjured up some dastardly spell to spirit away the remainder of Sir Geoff’s colleagues. Team Animal took full advantage and soon raced into a handsome lead. The Giraffe had joined the Club in 2015 as a left or right back, but he’s a credible right-winger and he had a field day, in cahoots with a particularly uncharitable Pudsey Bear. You could tell that The Onesies were getting serious when they all thrust back their hoods to get a better view. The Zebra got in on the act too – he had more runs than Pearson with dysentery.</p><p>Spurred into action, Kevin, Stuart and the other Minions looked for a master to serve. They found a suitable leader in the swashbuckling Pirate and whilst they were all involved, things looked good for the Humans. Their approach work invariably led to the Elf or the Monk trying to thwack their way through a particularly shiny Loopy. She shed plenty of tinsel, but despite the best efforts of both Christmas Spirit and the Holy Spirit, the net remained un-bulging. (Speaking of which, Batman may be a caped-crusader, but I don’t remember even Adam West ever wearing soggy grey Y-fronts on the outside of his trousers.)</p><p>Loopy’s tinsel had in fact made so much of a mess in the D that she decided to stay in it for the second half, even though the teams had changed ends. The Team Animal charge continued, however, and they were clearly finding things too easy when 118 man (other premium-rate information numbers are available) tackled the Dinosaur (his own team-mate).</p><p>Batman, stung by a sense of fair-play, decided to change sides, although not before embarrassing Disco Stu with a devastating turn of pace, hidden for years in waiting for just that moment. With the Dark Knight now in their ranks, Team Human upped the ante. Christmas Fairlie saw increasing action down the right flank, the Cowboy was a rootin’ and a’tootin’ along in central midfield and the Elf (clearly harbouring repressed attention issues after a Christmas period ‘All About Santa’) charged around like a man who’d had a touch too much popping candy. A vision in neon went close at the left post before the pressure finally told; Monsieur Barton manufacturing the first dodgy reverse stick goal of 2016. Obtenir de votre côté fort!</p><p>As is becoming traditional, a ‘next goal wins!’ scenario played out over the closing minutes. For one ghoulish moment, it appeared that the Spider might break clear, but she became entangled in a noisy web of her own making and the chance passed. In an incongruous game played by incongruous hockey players, the most incongruous of winners eventually arrived as (umpire) Kev bashed home to seal an unlikely victory for Team Human!</p><p>The final seconds were witnessed by Club stalwart, Jack Chalk. As he has now been mentioned in the match report, he owes £4.</p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/12507273_10154450917350476_4835571526775108094_n.jpg\" style=\"\"></p>";NULL;NULL;"2016-01-04 20:42:27";"31";"1";"0";;"entry_detail.html";"0";"0";"0";"0";"1";"zinnia/_entry_detail.html"

Lessons have been learned (not least that I didn’t have to go to Alford this season); hence, I give you…</p><h3>Act 1: The Exposition</h3><p><i>(Here, the audience learns the setting (Time/Place), characters are developed, and a conflict is introduced.)</i></p><p>So pre-pre-pre-drinks happened. Hannah Kenyon – I am blaming you for this. Meanwhile, the great and the good of Cambridge South were desperately YouTubing ‘how to tie a bowtie’ videos and laddering tights. But, by the time 6.30pm came around, a surprisingly smart bunch descended on the Cellar Bar within the rarefied environs of Clare College. One hundred and two Southerners, all dressed up to the nines and ready to party. But, there was to be no wine on the table…</p><h3>Act 2: Rising Action</h3><p><i>(The action of this act leads the audience to the climax. It is common for complications to arise, or for the protagonist to encounter obstacles.)</i></p><p>Not just that, but the two work-experience kids behind the bar had only 8 bottles of white wine for sale and the barrel of lager needed changing. Cath and Emma moved between the grumbling horde. ‘Why not have a Baileys?’, they suggested. The collective mood became decidedly febrile. Could the evening be rescued by a wild mushroom risotto and the champion of the piece, Chairman John Greaves?</p><h3>Act 3: The Climax</h3><p><i>(This is the turning point. The climax is characterized by the highest amount of suspense.)</i></p><p>Had Greaves faced greater challenges than this in his lifetime? Armed with nothing more than a winning smile, some stories about Andy T and a dodgy plastic lectern, he took to the stage. A hero waits for his moment though, so there was space for Dani Kilsby-Steele and Dom Nelson to rouse the naughty corner into a spot of heckling and Mark Williams to cop an understandable barb about his previous failings as M1s skipper. After each of the gallant team captains had tried their hand, Greaves re-took the microphone, with the evening hanging on a knife-edge.</p><p>You could hear a pin drop. The atmosphere was positively chewy. He began.</p><p>At once the spell was broken. The man can play a room like the Pied Piper himself. First, some warm words for the usual suspects on the committee. Then, a heartfelt thanks to the organisers of the evening. Finally, his twin aces - he presented a pair of awards that brought the house down; to Ania (for all-round splendid behaviour across a series of tasks) and Jim (for looking less like Xabi Alonso than he did last year). It was magnificent.</p><p></p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/ClubManAndWoman2016.jpg\" style=\"\"></p><br><p></p><h3>Act 4: Falling Action</h3><p><i>(The opposite of Rising Action, in the Falling Action the story is coming to an end, and any unknown details or plot twists are revealed and wrapped up.)</i></p><p>The mob was sated. They collapsed, giddy, into each other, with back-slapping a’plenty and selfies galore. The staff at Clare ushered us downstairs where, glory be, the bar had been re-stocked! The Rock had by now consumed three packets of bacon fries, hastily purchased by his selfless wing-man, El Sid, and was back in good humour. Rosselli was beaming, surely. Dabb was gleaming, demurely.</p><h3>Act 5: Denouement or Resolution</h3><p><i>(This is the final outcome of the drama. Here the author’s tone about his or her subject matter is revealed, and sometimes a moral or lesson is learned.)</i></p><p>Eventually, every curtain must come down, and so it was at midnight that we were thrust, like babes from the teat, into the wilds of Cambridge. The potential options were numerous and varied. Fez? Bed? Addenbrookes? It is one of the strengths of the club that we cater for many different characters and each found something to satisfy themselves in the early morning hours. The moral of the story? PLAY FOR CAMBRIDGE SOUTH!</p><p>(And perhaps have a piece of cheese on toast before you go out)</p><p>(At the risk of sermonising, maybe alternating between water and wine throughout the evening might be an idea too)</p><h3>Author’s note</h3><p>In the interest of dramatic effect, some or all of the above may bear little resemblance to what actually took place.</p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/OutstandingTosser.jpg\" style=\"float: none; margin: 0px;\" alt=\"The Author\"></p><br><p></p>";NULL;NULL;"2016-04-24 16:39:42";"34";"1";"0";;"entry_detail.html";"0";"0";"0";"0";"1";"zinnia/_entry_detail.html"

By Friday evening cars were packed, tutus were purchased and everyone was tucked in bed early ready for a big weekend of hockey fun!</p><p>We arrived on Saturday morning to a bright and very breezy Ely. T-shirts were handed out and the rabble divided into 2 teams with names to match the tournament theme of <i>Around the World</i>: Cambridge South Navigators and Gulliver's Southerners.</p><p></p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/IMG_2653.JPG\" style=\"\"></p><br><p></p><p></p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/IMG_2655.JPG\" style=\"\"></p><br><p></p><p>Saturday's 6 matches were to determine rankings for Sunday's cup and plate competitions but in true Ely style we had put the sole bottle opener to good use by the start of the second match. Turns out we play better with a little liquid courage! Pitching tents (and especially gazebos) proved difficult in the windy conditions but eventually The Palace was erected in the middle of the Cambridge South village!</p><p>The matches were played between 2 pitches, one at Ely Hockey Club and the other at a nearby school which was only a short tractor ride away!</p><p>The hockey was of a high standard across all the teams. The captain of Gulliver's Southerners Chris (<b>Tractor McTractorface</b>) Pearson led is team to several victories over the course of the day resulting in a place in the cup draw for Sunday. The Cambridge Navigators played well, Harriet (<b>Harri Potter</b>) Walker proving indestructible and Douglas (<b>Douglas</b>) Gibson was a force to be reckoned with in defence, but the oranges found themselves in the plate draw for Sunday. After a busy but dry day day of hockey, the rain came just as the matches finished, but thanks to Emma (<b>Default Fairlie</b>) Fairlie's gazebo (now flying at half mast thanks to the wind) we all managed to stay dry enough to enjoy the paella and churros on offer. Unfortunately we had to say goodbye to a few team members who were unavailable to stay, special thanks from the pink team to Lou (<b>I don't need a t-shirt</b>) G for her great efforts in goal and to Louisa (<b>Louser</b>) Cantwell for using her limbs to stop goals from being scored despite a lack of padding and also thanks from the orange team to Shin (<b>Too cool for camping</b>) Kim for his amazing aerial over the fence behind him and of course to Matt (<b>Saint Gower</b>) Saint Gower for being amazing in goal for any team that would have him!</p><p>Thoughts went ahead to the fancy dress party in the clubhouse that evening. The Palace became the hub for drinking games (up my you-know-what please) and unveiling of the costumes. Kim (<b>Solid 8.5</b>) Cooil proved that the world really does revolve around her, Ali (<b>Engine</b>) Edge was ready for anything in a penguin poncho and Laura (<b>Zoo keeper</b>) Edge was all wrapped up for an early Christmas. Highlights from the party included witnessing the courting ritual of lemurs thanks to Matt (<b>King Julien</b>) Kern and also the rare sight of a turkey quite literally shaking it's tail feathers in the form of Tom (<b>Rosselini</b>) Rosselli! After we drank the bar dry of green apple cactus jacks, we crawled back to our Cambridge south village, still not sure how Wilco (<b>Bydd Cydweithredu</b>) Dijkstra managed to fit in his wee tent!!</p><p>After a night of raving and chatting til the small hours (and in my case being squished by Naomi (<b>Cheeky Upstart</b>) Penfold and Emma...cuddly sleepers) We woke to a warm and sunny Sunday! Bacon baps and lots of coffee revived the hungover &nbsp;rabble and we were ready to kick ass in the cup and plate competitions!</p><p>Despite their best efforts, Gulliver's Southerners didn't manage to make it to the final of the cup but they put up a strong fight with great attacking from Liz (<b>Dunsby</b>) Dunsby and James (<b>Bury Me</b>) Matthews and defended well thanks to Julie (<b>Dark Horse</b>) Sadler and Laurie (<b>Lil Ms Chatterbox</b>) McKenzie.</p><p></p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/IMG_2656.JPG\" style=\"\"></p><br><p></p><p>The Cambridge Navigators won 2 out of their 4 games thanks to goals from Colin (<b>Trill</b>) Troll and Sophie (<b>Queenie</b>) McComish which meant we made to to the final of the plate against the Ely beach bums! The game ended a draw after 20 minutes and it decided 10 minutes of golden goal would be played. This is where I must hang my head in shame...quite possibly my miss of the season resulted in the match going to penalty flicks! Despite Jason Mann's best efforts &nbsp;and Felicity (<b>Castaway</b>) Rennys smooth technique (maybe she can show Graham (<b>Pretty Fly For a Short Guy</b>) McCulloch where the goal is) we lost the game.</p><p></p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/IMG_2657.JPG\" style=\"\"></p><br><p></p><p>Cue the sentimental music...Even though neither of our teams managed to take home any silverware, in the end it wasn't about the hockey, it was about having fun with your friends and team mates, drinking warm beer, dressing up like a massive turkey and singing along to 90s boy bands. Thanks to everyone who played, I personally had a great holiday.</p><p>Though maybe in future we should cool down or something???</p>";NULL;NULL;"2016-05-27 07:51:10";"36";"1";"0";;"entry_detail.html";"0";"0";"0";"0";"1";"zinnia/_entry_detail.html"

Quite literally. It was semi-finals night, but at 7.30 the prospects for the most un-summer like summer tournament on record were not looking good. The rain was torrenting down in rivers and the pitch resembled a paddling pool.</p><p>Still, the BBC weather app (maintained by our own Simon Frampton, so I always trust what it says) was forecasting that it would be dry by 8pm. With unshakeable confidence in the prodigious draining properties of the Long Road surface, it was decided to push the start time back by 30 minutes and trust conditions would be playable.</p><p>And it turned out we were right to do so, for the rain stopped, the waters receded and lo, a dove appeared bearing a green olive leaf in its beak. Well, maybe not that last one. But anyway, we were game on.</p><p>And what cracking games they turned out to be. First on were the Plate semi-finalists, Average Joes taking on Cambridge North and TFI Thursday up against Southern Saints. The Joes, winless in their group games, came good at the right moment, Simon Frampton contributing a brace of goals as well as his rain-stopping powers to seal a 2-1 win.</p><p>At the other end, TFI Thursday were back to nearly full strength after last week's depleted numbers, and raced into a 3-1 half time lead over a more threadbare Southern Saints, adding another after half time to wrap up a solid 4-1 victory. The Southern Saints were so despondent that they all promptly disappeared without providing an umpire for the next game, which meant in a 3 goal penalty for a final score of 7-1.</p><p>Next up were the big boys - the Cup teams. Melbourn Outriders were fielding a bare 7 but still managed to take an early lead against St Ives 2, but St Ives came back to lead 2-1 at half time. The second half was goalless, and Melbourn were left to rue what might have been.

True to form, the weather was cool and threatening, but a pre-game shower proved to be a false harbinger and in the end we were spared another evening of torrential rain.&nbsp;</p><p>Kicking off proceedings were the 3rd place play-off matches. In the Plate competition, Cambridge North recovered from their surprise exit to Average Joes last week to see off Southern Saints 3-0. Down the other end, McMinions raced into a 5 goal lead in the Cup play-off before a consolation for Melbourn Outiders as a hard hit directly into the D received a perfect deflection from Jan, elevating it off the deck and past the stranded Jason in goal before he even had time to react, 5-1 the final score.</p><p>The undercard concluded, it was time for the main programme. The Plate final proved to be thrillingly contested, Average Joes taking the lead near the end of the first half after a mis-kick howler from Lino in TFI Thursday's goal presented the simplest of chances. TFI came back to level with an intricately worked goal in the second period before the Joes retook the lead through an Amalia strike. TFI weren't done though, and as the final minutes ticked down captain Colin lead by example as he surged forward from defence to slot home. By this point, with the winners' trophies in sight the early summer friendly casualness had been replaced by a desperate desire to win from both teams - witness Colin's bellow on equalising.</p><p>So we had the first penalty flick contest of the tournament. The Joes won the toss and put TFI up first in the best of three. Colin duly scored before Jack stepped up and did the same. James Mathews restored TFI's lead and, with the pressure on, Lino went from zero to hero as he redeemed his earlier whoopsy with a low-down save from Joes' captain, Rob 'Reverse Stick' Barton. If Lino's reaction wasn't quite Stuart Pearce, it was certainly heartfelt. Flix stepped up to take TFI's third flick and nervelessly clinched it to send TFI into raptures and leave the Joes draped over the hoardings.</p><p>The contest for the title of overall tournament champions was an all St Ives affair though. Another tight match was still goalless at half time and for a while it looked as if both competitions would be decided with flicks. In the end though, St Ives 1s lived up to their numerical designation, finally breaking the 2s' resistance to take the lead before a second goal with a minute or so to go sealed the win and the Cup Champions' title with it.</p><p>Both teams of winning finalists then collected their trophies before all the teams received their (edible) tournament medals.</p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/finals.jpg\" style=\"width: 601.6681514476614px; height: 451px;\"></p>";NULL;NULL;"2016-07-01 20:21:24";"41";"1";"0";;"entry_detail.html";"0";"0";"0";"0";"1";"zinnia/_entry_detail.html"

The club has since helped support OTHL by donating playing shirts, sticks and equipment, as well as through raising funds at club quiz nights.</p><p>Last week I heard from Mr Arumugam, the founder of OTHL, that one of the boys from the program, Kishore Arya, was selected to represent India in this year's Under 17 Asia Cup tournament in Dhaka. Kishore, whose father is a rickshaw driver, has been part of OTHL in 2014 and represented Delhi last year. We hope that this will inspire many kids from similar backgrounds to pick up a hockey stick.

Spikey Mike was being less impressive, deciding it was acceptable to keep everyone waiting twenty minutes for his arrival following a night on the town and a bad hangover (although no facial injuries were incurred this time).</p><p>We arrived at Saffron Walden (which actually is, and always has been, Newport) and the first priority was to set up base camp. We found ourselves an excellent spot overlooking one end of the pitch, only to later discover that all our matches were to be played at the opposite end.</p><p>We had two good quality teams this year, aptly named ‘Cambridge South 1’ (in green) and ‘Cambridge South 2’ (in purple)</p><p></p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/green.JPG\" style=\"\"></p><br><p></p><p></p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/purple.JPG\"></p><br><p></p><p>The Green team had the ever-enthusiastic Matt Saint-Gower in goal and the Purple team had Cameron, who in this photo looks strangely like some kind of Transformer (Camerontron is the best name I can come up with):</p><p></p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/keeper.JPG\"></p><br><p></p><p>The games got started and then promptly finished, as they were only ten minutes each. We found ourselves drawing a lot of games as there was little time to actually score. However, both teams played really well and certainly put up a good fight against the other sides, in what was a very competitive tournament.</p><p>As both teams were in the same group we had to play each other, the game ending in an epic 0-0 draw (as mentioned, there was just about enough time to get a couple of shots off). This was a relief as I had aimed to select the teams to be as equal as possible.</p><p>Some off pitch incidents brought amusement for all, including Hannah’s hill rolling (see the video on our Twitter account as I have no idea how to get it on to this report) and trying to work out how Amalia’s name was pronounced (‘A-mah- lia’ or ‘A-may- lia’): eventually someone just asked Amalia who filled us in (it’s the former, or you can just call her ‘Ama’, she doesn’t mind either way). Andy ‘The Cavalry’ T arrived with a single ten minute match left (and was also subbed during the game – total game time was probably five minutes). He also decided to turn up with no purple shirt, so I leant him mine: he stood out in the sudden downpour that hit at 3pm before handing this back for washing.</p><p>The group stages consisted of two groups of six teams. The Greens finished fourth (although on level points with the teams who came second and third, separated only by goal difference) and the Purples narrowly missed out on a semi- final spot in fifth place (ahead of hosts, Saffron Walden Vets).</p><p>The Greens played Saffron Walden in the semi-final of the Plate competition. Walden took an early lead, however we had most of the possession and eventually got an equaliser. I’m proud to say that my ‘spinny thing’ actually had a positive outcome for the first time ever and got us the equaliser. The game was decided on penalty flicks, which were won by our opponents.</p><p>We hastily left after this, so I have no idea who won the competition. Thanks to everyone that took part, I think everyone had a good time.</p><p>The mixed action continues this weekend at St Ives. We are entering two teams, which is brilliant news. This is possibly the last event for this season’s mixed captains, who incidentally both can’t make this one.</p><p>I’d like to take this opportunity on behalf of both Sophie and myself to say thanks so much to everyone who’s played for the mixed teams this year, it has been great fun.</p><p></p>";NULL;NULL;"2016-07-04 20:30:41";"42";"1";"0";;"entry_detail.html";"0";"0";"0";"0";"1";"zinnia/_entry_detail.html"

Another big thank you to the goalkeepers that played all the games that evening! You guys worked hard all evening and managed to keep the scoreline low for all teams.</p><p>And now for a summary of the evening from the eyes of the captains...</p><h3>It's Strawberry Blonde, honest! – Captain Tom Rosellini</h3><p>Although suffering from both lack of souls disorder and gingeritis, the orange team managed to actually do well (Huzzah!). Even though the wooden spoon looked possible after 4 games we managed to actually score some goals. Special thanks to Coops for a wonderful goal in our final game, sealing 2nd place.</p><h3>It's Hockey, not Hockley! – Captain Jim Hockley</h3><p>We entered the Club Night tournament full of determination, grit and flair. A strong team of veteran players assembled around the red bibs knowing their one true aim was to come late on in the competition. The early matches against Purple, White and Blue all served as warm-up training for the main event. As the mighty 'It's Hockley, not Hockey alright (or something similar)' stepped onto the pitch, Paresh's 'Black Twigs' shed their leaves, trembling with anticipation with what turned out to be an embarrassing and lack-lustre performance for the All Black wannabes (or should I say wallabies). It would be nice to say it was an even game, but frankly the team in Red outshone the rather drab looking Twigs, showing style, skill and pizzazz, as they dominated the tormented and depressed Blacks. A weak and patchy defence was a particular problem for the Kids from Down Under. With that game well and truly under their belt, the team in Red went on to a solid and well deserved mid-table finish.</p><p>History is written by the winners (or at least non-losers), I've had a beer and I'm waiting for a lift.</p><h3>Tactical Subbuteo – Captain Simon Cooper</h3><p>The highlight of Team Tactical Subbuteo's evening was undoubtedly the Frampton/Ludlow double-act that sealed a deserved win against a talented Blue team. Sadly, things went downhill from there, despite the best efforts of my willing and able teammates and the full range of goalkeepers on offer. Our decline was miserably capped by my disastrous own goal that finished the evening. Sorry guys! Incidentally, my favourite team was definitely the hapless pair of hopalong volunteers that ran the administration on the night. Jack and Oven, what a pair of wallies.</p><h3>Gnomes, PhD – Captain Naomi Penfold</h3><p>All the pink team wanted was to have some fun. With a blatant disregard for any form of structure or plan, they skipped onto the pitch fresh from learning lots of new names and oblivious to what would happen next. A win over the McComish super squad? No one would have bet it. And another? No losses? Well now. Throw the tactics book out the window fellas and lasses, cos it turns out that all you gotta do is leave everyone to their own devices and watch the magic (mikey, proud recipient of a single golden ball, looking to complete the set next time) happen. Stellar performances all round from Doug, Richard, Dave, Ed, Sam and Mikey, Hannah, Liz, Blythe and Caroline. Lovely interlinking play + simple substitutions + low expectations = lots of goals to celebrate. And celebrate we did, every time. Here's to a happy hockey squad. Thx fr th mmrs.</p><h3>Ground Interference – Captain Louisa Cantwell</h3><p>Ground Interference had a storming run to just below middle of the table at the first club night of the season, putting in some cracking performances to secure the vital draws that would give us the league position we'd been dreaming about since the end of the June tournament. The crushing dampener on the evening was losing the linchpin that is Colin Troll to a broken ankle in the penultimate game, and the rolling about on the floor like a football was justified by the midnight X-rays. Hope you're back on both feet soon Colin :(</p><h3>Scoring Royalty – Captain Sophie McComish</h3><p>Scoring Royalty all arrived well ahead of time and had completed a thorough warm up and detailed game plan before the first whistle blew. Unfortunately despite this forward planning we lost the first game to the pinks but it could only get better from there! We managed to either draw or win the rest of the matches with some really great individual and team goals. Personally not coming last is the best result I've had at club day so I'm very proud of the blues!</p><h3>The Black Twigs – Captain Paresh Parsot</h3><p>The Black Twigs performed very well at the Club Day Tournament with their dazzling passing skills and using their entire bench within the first 8 minutes of each game. Although the Black Twigs did bend a few times, they never snapped leaving them unbeaten in the tournament. Unfortunately one win was not enough to win the Mighty Cup. However, the Black Twigs were stoked to take home Bronze and securing automatic qualification for next seasons Club Day Tournament. The Black Twigs would like to make a special mention to the Hockey and not Hockley team for somehow managing to play Hockey and not Hockley under a very inexperienced captain who has yet to win a toss. Thank God there were no half time team talks as this may have led the team to play Hockley (personnel com.

Keeper Owen dived to his left and saved Waveney’s first flick before Ewart scored to allow South the reach a 5-6th position play-off match against Norwich Drifters. An evenly contested match, that Cambridge South should have won, was lost in the dying minutes to the only goal of the game.</p><p>So, a slightly disappointing sixth place from eight but a very enjoyable day and the consolation that we held the tournament winners, Bracknell, to a goalless draw and were the only team they didn't manage to score against. If only those chances… Below are the results.</p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><b>Round</b></td><td><b>Opponents</b></td><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Result</b></td><td><b>Scorers</b></td></tr><tr><td>Group A</td><td>Bracknell</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">0-0</td><td><br></td></tr><tr><td>Group A</td><td>Waveney</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">0-0</td><td><br></td></tr><tr><td>Group A</td><td>Felixstowe</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">1-3</td><td>Butcher</td></tr><tr><td>5th/6th Play-off</td><td>Norwich Drifters</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">0-1</td><td><br></td></tr></tbody></table>";NULL;NULL;"2001-04-28 08:39:44";"46";"1";"0";;"entry_detail.html";"0";"0";"0";"0";"1";"zinnia/_entry_detail.html"

The informal nature of the tournament meant that no overall winner was confirmed but popular opinion decreed who it was to be.</p><p>On Day One the sun shone and goals flowed, but the Southerners slipped to a 5-0 defeat against Hawaii 5-Nil (Wisbech HC) mainly due to their relaxed start. Jim Thorpe was picked out by the opposition as the main danger. The Southerners did however display some of the skills which later proved to be…well, anyway. The second game, against Something Random, saw Southerners fall foul of some lucky goals (three in fact) whilst skillful twists and turns from those on the attack proved fruitless. Filling the interval between the two games with sleep, sun and beer may not have been the best tactical decision.</p><p>South lost the services of Richard York and Pip Noon after the first day;  Richard to the seduction of Las Vegas's pleasures, whilst Pip disappeared to…take over the world.  We have subsequently learned that (in her own words) Pip's Red, err no Yellow, erm Red (I think) armies were mercilessly crushed having gained control of South America and Asia. She should have followed the team's recommendation of strengthening Iceland and using Australia as a starting base. Pip is now in charge of running a 'Risk' social evening: all those in favour, let the social committee know.</p><p>After a day of solid beer drinking and several rather tasty rounds of G'n'T's as the sun went down, the evening social was the undoing of South. Jim T and Will B shamefully retired before 11:00 pm (separately, I may add) but Mick Beasley held the side up with an admirable display of drinking with the North Lincs College students.</p><p>Day Two, meant the arrival of Jim Sutcliffe and turned out to be hotter than Day One. The heat really took its toll on those playing. Mick's green complexion and desire to sleep meant a reshuffle to the line-up for the first game, against Lager Louts (Pelicans HC).  A mercenary keeper was brought in, allowing Will to move outfield and snatch Southerners' first goal of the tournament with a really nasty bobbling shot.  The grass pitch was more suited to the 'raw' play of the Cambridge side but the individual skill of Lager Louts (just two players really) saw them run out winners, by an extremely inflated 6-1.</p><p>Tactics came into play for the following game and Haggis Fraser was moved from the heart of defence to replace the resting Jim Thorpe in the role of midfield general. This proved to be successful as South dominated large sections of the following game against Mothballs (Wisbech HC). A brace of goals each from South's Dutch import, Wilco, and Haggis left South in the driving seat, but Mothballs were rescued by a combination of their centre forward and sweeper. These combined to frustrate strikers Sharon and Denise, whilst punishing the mercenary element of South's side. Manfully, Mick even made it on to the pitch. He was astounding for the period of time it took him to walk from one side of the pitch to the other, before lying down to recuperate.</p><p>Wizards, already acknowledged as the best side by some distance with wins of 9-0 and 13-2 on the first day, were the Southerners' final opponents. After ten minutes the game was nil-nil and very evenly matched. Johnnie B and Jim S marshalled the defence, with Haggis running the midfield, assisted by the now-mobile Messers Thorpe and Beasley. Unfortunately cracks began to show in South's defence and Wizards used their substitutes well to allow players to rest in the stifling heat. Goal chances appeared and were generally well taken. The team remained dedicated (Johnnie B even sliding across the line to save one shot) and continued to work hard across the pitch. Wilco and Denise kept the attacking force running down each wing, supported well from midfield and even defence when possible, as the pressure mounted. Wizards' better skill, goal-hanging centre forward and chances to rest resulted in them being embarrassingly, but not shamefully, 9-0 winners.</p><p>The weekend could be summarised as not a wildly successful tournament on the pitch, but socially an absolute blast. The Wisbech Festival is already pencilled in for next season, when who knows what could happen.</p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><b>Opponents</b></td><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Result</b></td><td><b>Scorers</b></td></tr><tr><td>Hawaii 5-Nil</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">0-5</td><td><br></td></tr><tr><td>Something Random</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">0-3</td><td><br></td></tr><tr><td>Lager Louts</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">1-6</td><td>W Benedikz</td></tr><tr><td>Mothballs</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">4-4</td><td>Fraser (2), Dijkstra (2)</td></tr><tr><td>Wizards</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">0-9</td><td><br></td></tr></tbody></table><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/Wisbech%20Fest%200501%20-%20Mick%20Beasley%20embodies%20%28and%20drinks%20most%20of%29%20the%20spirit%20of%202001.%20%20It%20was%20less%20funny%20later..JPG\" style=\"float: none; margin: 0px; width: 250px;\" title=\"Mick Beasley embodies (and drinks most of) the spirit of 2001.

Despite the loss of players at the last minute, which decimated the squad from twelve to just eight players, the team performed beyond all expectations and finished fourth. The tournament was host to twelve men's and three ladies' teams from Holland, Ireland and England. The most incriminating photos have been burnt, whilst a choice selection of those which won't lead to criminal prosecution, travel bans or divorce, have been posted on the photos page [Editor's note: unfortunately, now lost to posterity].</p><p>The intrepid tour party were as follows:</p><ul><li><p>GK - Will Benedikz</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Defence - John Benedikz, Ian Black, Jim Sutcliffe</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Midfield - Jim Lockhart (Capt), Hannes Roux, Dan Talmage</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Forward - Wilko Dijkstra</p></li></ul><p>The trip over to Holland proved to be uneventful despite the early start and Wilco's spur of the moment decision to take the team on a tour of the Amsterdam inner ring-road. The host side spent the evening 'softening up' the other teams using a plentiful supply of fine alcohol, which they served in deceptively small (and light) plastic glasses. The features of the glasses lead to the discovery of an experimental form of drinking which cannot really be described without the aid of the photos. Despite such low tactics, all eight players emerged for the start of the tournament (even if Boy Wonder was a little greener than ideal).</p><p>Assisted by three Dutch mercenaries, the morning saw Cambs South faced the eventual third placed side, Phoenix Heren II (Holland), and the English side began inauspiciously, losing 3-0 to the far better team. The game was not entirely one sided but South suffered as they became used to their additional players. The result meant that second game necessitated some tactical changes. The recruitment of De Zomerbloesems' (Amstelveen Ladies side) keeper allowed Will to move out of the pads and up front. The move worked well and his scrappy goal meant Cambridge led OHC Bully (Holland) 1-0. Dogmatic defence, especially by Johnnie B and Jim Sutcliffe, and outstanding keeping, meant that despite an onslaught from the Dutch, Cambridge hung on to take the points. As the weather deteriorated into showers and a sharp breeze South took the pitch for their third game which saw the foreign sides (South and University College Cork) drawn against each other. The Irish team worked together well and made short work of the game running out 4-0 winners.</p><p>Saturday finished with an unorganised and unofficial game, against De Zomerbloesems, with a varying numbers of players on either side. The ladies were aided by the return of their keeper and her influence proved crucial. South were denied a chance to settle the game and the lack of goals proved costly as the Ladies' captain turned to score with the final touch of the game.</p><p>The Alkmaar bars hosts were only too happy to swap the above items for more small beer on Saturday night and this could have ultimately been the cause of lost opportunities for some of the team. During the days play the captain of the Dutch ladies' side was injured by a ball to the nose. In the evening, Ian 'Smoothie' Black played the gracious gentleman and enquired after the poor girl's health. When asked how the unfortunate damsel's proboscis appeared, he played the utter eejit and replied, 'Still big.' Following a short moment of silence the remainder of the conversation switched into Dutch and square one was firmly regained.</p><p>Jim L had obviously partied well on Saturday night and didn't appear in time for the first (three) games of Sunday. All efforts to raise him failed and South battled on without him. A young Dutch recruit was enlisted for the day who, despite his tender years, proved to be the centre forward Cambridge had been missing on Saturday. The first game against GHBS wasn't helped by it being played in the morning, or involving running around. Those with the least sore heads, Dan and Wilco, played blinders and should both have scored, but it was the Dutch team who scored first as the defence were left exposed by their hangovers. At 2-0 down, Cambridge broke forward and our centre forward buried the ball to start what could have been a come back. It was not to be and, despite hitting the bar later, South failed to play to our strengths before collapsing to a 4-1 defeat.</p><p>Blauvingers were the second opponents of the day. These were a team who had learnt from the hosts and on Saturday night had supplied all other teams present with free shots of rather fine mistletoe brandy. That, and the fact they were a good deal better than South, didn't bode well. Despite these odds Cambridge settled down well and for the first ten minutes kept the Dutch side contained. The English side used their players in defence and this proved to be a good tactic as the Dutch sides in the tournament concentrated mainly on attacking play, leaving themselves very open at the back, especially to counter-attacking. Blauvingers didn't allow many attacking opportunities and ran out 4-0 winners in a very relaxed game. Jim S and Johnnie B both saved South from a heavier defeat. The former very casually turned the ball around the post, to the Dutch sides amusement, after Will in goal was beaten, and John stepped behind the keeper to reach a shot later in the game.</p><p>The game against the combined Irish Ladies teams from University Colleges of Cork and Dublin gave South our only other point of the tournament. Our goal in the 1-1 draw was scored by the borrowed striker.</p><p>Mid-Sunday afternoon, South were struck with a piece of luck the could have resulted in silverware. Due to our hosts generosity at the bar most of the other teams in the tournament had become incapable of playing, and the final teams standing (Cambridge, UCC, Blauvingers and Phoenix) were hastily organised into two semi-finals. The all-Dutch game was extremely tight and was something of an exhibition game for the foreign teams. Blauvingers scored early in the match to win 1-0, before Cambridge took to the big stage.</p><p>As the support gathered, this was easily the best supported match of the weekend. South's starting line up was rearranged with a total of four Dutchmen guesting for Cambridge. The game was much closer than the previous encounter and neither side looked like breaking through, with the Cambridge defence of Johnnie B, Jim S, Hannes and Blackie stifling every Irish attack. The team played with much greater cohesion than in previous games and the defence were supported by Jim S and Dan from midfield. The French U21 international, although a little the worse for wear, failed to have the expected impact and when Cambridge broke forward through Wilco we looked dangerous. Shortly before half-time a dribble from the centre of the midfield was left, uncharacteristically, unchecked and UCC took the lead through a strong shot.</p> <p>As Irish confidence soared and Cambridge were rocked, tactical substitutions were made. Wilco was replaced on the left wing by Will and fresh Dutch legs were brought on at centre forward. The change took effect almost immediately as Jim S, still full of running from his extended rest, pushed the ball forward behind the advancing UCC defence. Will caught the ball with a (very skillful or perhaps lucky) reverse stick shot that sent the ball looping over the keeper and into the back of the net. The game picked up in pace as both sides believed in a possible victory. Ultimately sheer weight of numbers saw a free man at the back of the Cambridge D. The cross was not wasted and Cambridge's chances of reaching the final were ended.</p><p>At the end of the day, the better team had won but UCC proved no match for Blauvingers and lost the final 2-0. Phoenix were awarded third place on the strength of their better performances over the weekend. Cambridge can be extremely proud of their performance (and 4th place) which was reached with just a little help from Dutch friends.</p><p>Even getting home was undertaken in the spirit of adventure. The lead car spent twenty minutes searching for the ferry boarding passes at The Hook - before discovering them on their dashboard. Once back in the UK, Wilco's desire to tour was still strong and, having disembarked from the ferry, headed for London. The mistake was realised at the M25 and the second car arrived home nearly 90 minutes after the first.</p><p>Many thanks to those who made the trip worthwhile and also to Alkmaar HC for making us so welcome. Holland could well see Cambridge South again next season.</p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><b>Round</b></td><td><b>Opponents</b></td><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Result</b></td><td><b>Scorers</b></td></tr><tr><td>League</td><td>Phoenix Heren II</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">0-3</td><td><br></td></tr><tr><td>League</td><td>Heren III OHC Bully</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">1-0</td><td>W Benedikz</td></tr><tr><td>League</td><td>University College Cork</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">0-4</td><td><br></td></tr><tr><td>League</td><td>De Zomerbloesems (Ladies)</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">0-1</td><td><br></td></tr><tr><td>League</td><td>Heren 10 GHBS</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">1-4</td><td>A Guest</td></tr><tr><td>League</td><td>De Blauvingers</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">0-4</td><td><br></td></tr><tr><td>League</td><td>UC Cork/Dublin (Ladies)</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">1-1</td><td>A Guest</td></tr><tr><td>Semi-final</td><td>University College Cork</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">1-2</td><td>W Benedikz</td></tr></tbody></table>";NULL;NULL;"2001-06-19 12:16:42";"48";"1";"0";;"entry_detail.html";"0";"0";"0";"0";"1";"zinnia/_entry_detail.html"

Brian from Cambridge City and two players from Felixstowe, Jez and Howard, augmented this group.</p><p>So a brilliant sunny day started at 10.30 with bacon rolls and tea on arrival, and Red Bull to cure hangovers for others after finding a sunglasses shop first!</p><p>We were in a group with Bury St Edmunds, last year’s runners-up, Waveney and Clacton. The other group comprised Bracknell, the cup holders, Felixstowe, Drifters and Braintree.</p><p>South's first game was against Clacton and this ended with a one-nil win which was more comfortable than the score indicates. The goal came from an attack down the right with John Bicknell feeding Howard, who hammered the ball home. Before this Roger Craigen had seen a shot hit the wrong side of the post and Richard Bettison also came close. Geoff Butcher, John and James Bridge controlled our midfield.</p><p>Roy Todd in goal was in charge of the defence, where Mick Beasley was sweeping with Brian, Jez and Mike Gronow in front of him. Clacton’s attack couldn’t find a way through, apart from one occasion when Roy pulled of a good save diving to his left.</p><p>Our second game immediately followed this win and saw a hard fought game against Waveney, who came well organised with a squad of fifteen players and wives and children in support. We were able to make one change from our squad of twelve and Peter Kemp came on for Mike. Although Cambridge South threatened Waveney on several occasions, it was our defence that had to work overtime and Roy pulled off several spectacular saves. Right at the end of the game, Brian pulled a muscle in his back and was not able to take any further part in the tournament. South came off the pitch pleased with a goalless draw against a team that had beaten us six-one a couple of weeks ago.</p><p>So two games played and four points.</p><p>After an hour’s rest, South took to the field against Bury for the final group game and the statisticians in our midst claimed that we could lose one-nil and still qualify for the semi-finals in second place.</p><p>The game saw two well-balanced teams play a very enjoyable game with good end-to-end hockey, with all the team contributing. Halfway through the game Bury took the lead and South faced the possibility of conceding another goal to go to the minor position play-offs and an early adjournment to the all-day bar. However, South dug in and pressed forward and our efforts were rewarded when James broke Bury’s defence and passed to Richard at the top of the circle. He turned and pushed the ball to his right where Howard slipped the ball under the diving keeper who crashed into Richard. The goal looked messy but was in fact a good move.</p><p>So the game ended in a one-one draw and these two points saw CS top our group with Waveney in second place. In the other group, Felixstowe finished first with Bracknell runners up.</p><p>After a fifteen minute break for beer and sustenance, we took to the field again for our semi-final, but with no substitutes available to us some limbs were already starting to ache. The game was again a good one and ended in a goalless draw. Either there were no really memorable moments or my memory is failing! The rules stipulated that the game would be decided on sudden death penalty flicks and the drama built. Bracknell won the toss and took the first flick that Roy saved down to his right. So all the pressure was on Mick Beasley, who was volunteered – one step and a mis-struck flick…BUT the goalkeeper had moved the wrong way and the ball ended inside the post. Cambridge South were into the final.</p><p>The other semi-final also ended in a similar fashion and Waveney beat Felixstowe.</p><p>After a much-needed break of forty minutes while the play-offs for the minor places took place, South took to the field and were unlucky not to take a lead midway through the first half, when John pushed the ball across the circle to Roger who was stick tackled whilst making his shot. A short corner was awarded that another umpire might have awarded a flick for. But it was Waveney who scored shortly before half time when a shot that was going just wide of the post was deflected into the goal off a defender’s foot. At half time Waveney made a couple of substitutes from their large squad and pressed forward straight from the restart. A ten minute spell saw them score another three goals as Cambridge South ran out of steam. However the lads didn’t give up and nearly claimed a late consolation goal when Richard’s reverse flick looked destined for the top corner. The goalie got his helmet in the way and the ball glanced off it for a corner.</p><p>And there South's dream of glory ended, with a very tired squad have giving everything to the cause. And yes, the limbs have now recovered five days after the event!</p><p>A marvellous day out, great weather, all-day bar and dreams of next year with hopefully a larger squad.</p><p>Cambridge South's Man of the Tournament award goes to Roy Todd.</p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><b>Round</b></td><td><b>Opponents</b></td><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Result</b></td><td><b>Scorers</b></td></tr><tr><td>Pool</td><td>Clacton</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">1-0</td><td>Howard</td></tr><tr><td>Pool</td><td>Waveney</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">0-0</td><td><br></td></tr><tr><td>Pool</td><td>Bury St Edmunds</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">1-1</td><td>Bettison</td></tr><tr><td>Semi-final</td><td>Bracknell</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">1-0</td><td>Beasley</td></tr><tr><td>Final</td><td>Waveney</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">0-4</td><td><br></td></tr></tbody></table><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/VetsFelixstowe02.jpg\"></p>";NULL;NULL;"2002-04-29 12:53:13";"49";"1";"0";;"entry_detail.html";"0";"0";"0";"0";"1";"zinnia/_entry_detail.html"

Things started badly for the Greens, going two goals down early in the piece. However, they pulled one back with an excellent individual goal from Tash Cox. Chasing hard for a loose ball everyone thought she had no chance making was the basis. Once the ball had been retrieved, the Marauders defence, who were standing watching with the rest of us, were far too far away to prevent Tash dribbling along the by-line then drawing the Neots keeper and classly flicking the ball over her diving body.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the sleep was still in the Greens' eyes and a further goal was conceded to see Neots three-one up. The Greens then created a number of chances to get back into the game but couldn’t capitalise. Worst offender being Tony Wiskich, who found himself with only a defender on the line to beat, ball on his stick, on the penalty spot. He took his time, lined-up his flick, and shanked it three yards wide. Ouch. [Sorry Tony, but it was miss of the day for the whole tournament, y’know…]</p><p>The Blacks made their debut in the tournament in the following game, against a youthful but skilful Saffron Walden I side. The Blacks found it hard to cope with the young legs of their opponents and were indebted to keeper Cassie Woodfin for a number of saves, keeping the score respectable. Three shots found their way past her but it could have been more. The Blacks got on the sheet themselves, when John Benedikz slammed home a short corner with the final hit of the match. So, two games, two 3-1 defeats. Not greatly auspicious.</p><p>At this point the games were coming thick and fast and after a break for one match, the Blacks were back out to face Harlow. This match proved more even, with the Blacks having now sorted out their team pattern, with Cesca Freeman linking neatly with Jan Brynjolffsen up front. Once again Cassie excelled between the sticks, keeping out some shots from the oppo's dangerous ‘Worm’ twins (that’s what it said on their shirts…), who had scored four between them in Harlow’s opening match, including a couple of spectacular ones. However, whilst Cassie could block the original shots she needed her defence to pick up the loose balls, and twice they failed to and therefore saw efforts scrambled home. The Blacks pulled one back in the dying minutes, when a break down the left by Cesca saw her put a neat move on her marker and pull the ball back inside to Jan arriving late into the D. His shot was deflected almost at source, which added a spin that saw the ball squeeze in at the near post past the wrong footed keeper. However, an equaliser couldn’t be fashioned and whilst the performance was far better, the result was the same.</p><p>Once again, it was straight on with the South action as the Greens strode out to play their second fixture, against the Cunning Linguists (Bishops Stortford? I never found that one out). From the outset, the Greens looked the dominant team, creating many chances. Their first goal came when a Tony pass found Tash in space in the middle of the D. She waited calmly for the keeper to dive before lifting the ball over him. Tony soon doubled the money, cracking the ball home from the top of the D. More and more chances were being created, with the Linguists looking tired and the Greens often through three-on-two or even, once, four-on-one. Finally, the forwards combined well enough to score one of these, when Rupert Webb took a Tash pass and flicked home with his reverse stick. One neatly taken Linguists goal at the other end failed to throw the Greens off their stride, Tash netting again at the far post from Rupert’s driven cross. The final action of the game saw the Linguists beat Peter Grant for a second time, as the Green defence had disappeared upfield in search of personal glory. Even so, 4-2 was a good win.</p><p>At this point in proceedings, both South teams found themselves with a break in their matches. Given the beautiful sunny weather, it was out with the beer and the sandwiches and time for the Blacks to commiserate properly with Tony for his miss in the first game. Also the Greens were watching intently to find out what they needed to do in their final match to make the semis. Well, some of them. Others were in the bar. They claimed they were watching football; I remain unconvinced.</p><p>So, to the final matches. First up were the Blacks, who faced a Long Sutton team who looked player-for-player the best in the tournament. This one was essentially a long rearguard action and the final score of five-nil to Long Sutton was hardly unfair. Then came the Greens for the big one. Other results meant that a win and nothing else in their final game, against Saffron Walden II, was required. Unfortunately, the same was also true of the host side. And just like at the start of the tournament, a lack of team work in the opening period of the match porved terminal, as the Greens found themselves two down in double-quick time. One was pulled back by Tim Gass, forcing home after the keeper had blocked Gemma Thomas’s original effort. In the final minute of the match, with South throwing the kitchen sink at Walden for an equaliser, they were caught on the break to leave the final score 3-1.</p><p>All in all a good day, even if there was the nagging feeling that the Greens were good enough to have gone further in the tournament. The weather certainly smiled on us and our hosts were very pleasant. Definitely a tournament to pencil in again for next season.</p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Blacks</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>Opponents</b></td><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Result</b></td><td><b>Scorers</b></td></tr><tr><td>Saffron Walden I</td><td>1-3</td><td>Benedikz</td></tr><tr><td>Harlow</td><td>1-2</td><td>Brynjolffssen</td></tr><tr><td>Long Sutton</td><td>0-5</td><td><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Greens</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>Opponents</b></td><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Result</b></td><td><b>Scorers</b></td></tr><tr><td>Marauders</td><td>1-3</td><td>Cox</td></tr><tr><td>Cunning Linguists</td><td>4-2</td><td>Cox (2), Wiskich, Webb</td></tr><tr><td>Saffron Walden II</td><td>1-3</td><td>Gass</td></tr></tbody></table>";NULL;NULL;"2005-06-19 16:03:30";"50";"1";"0";;"entry_detail.html";"0";"0";"0";"0";"1";"zinnia/_entry_detail.html"

In spite of the snow on the ground on the journey, the pitches were all clear and the weather stayed dry and bright for the day.</p><p>Cambridge South were drawn in a group with the hosts Felixstowe along with Bracknell, Braintree and Bury St.Edmunds. The other group consisted of Norwich Exiles, Clacton, Waveney, Cranes and Uccles from Belgium.</p><p>Our first game, after a welcome mug of tea and a bacon roll, was against Braintree. We borrowed a couple of players from teams in the other group and South took an early two goal lead with a good strike from Stephen Fleck followed by the first in many years from Steve Riches. How does a sweeper turn up in the circle at the right moment? Completely out of position or a demonstration how superior South were at the time, playing some very good hockey? Unfortunatelym Braintree fought back and a good goal coupled with a lapse of concentration in the South defence saw them draw level. However just as the final whistle went, South were awarded a short corner and from this Ricky Williams hammered the ball home from a very tight angle on the right.</p><p>After a short break, we took the field against Bracknell and an evenly balanced match took place, played in the best of spirits as the first one had been. Jim Sutcliffe in goal made several good saves when the defence of Steve Riches, Peter Kemp, Mick Beasley and Geoff Butcher was breached. The midfield of Stephen Fleck and Keith Davidson, assisted by a guest, gave good service to the front players who were Ricky Williams and Roger Craigen, helped by another loan player. The only goal of the game was scored by Cambridge South when Roger hammered home a through ball from Ricky.</p><p>So five points out of a possible six from the first two games and an hour’s break before the crucial game against Felixstowe. This was the host’s final game and they had remained undefeated so far and both sides realised that this was the crunch game – the winner going through to the final against the other group winner.</p><p>Playing some excellent hockey, South took an early lead with a move down the right which saw another perfect through ball from Ricky meet our guest player from Waveney who slipped the ball past the keeper. This goal drew out the worst reaction from a couple of the young vets in the opposition team who played in an aggressive, unsporting way for the rest of the game. Unfortunately, the umpires lost control and we conceded two hotly contested goals and lost the game two-one. The two qualified umpires in the South defence, along with another who umpires regularly, all said that they would have had no hesitation in sending off the offending players for dangerous play and language.</p><p>Our final game in the group was academic and resulted in a goalless draw against Bury, with Steve Riches limping off with a pulled hamstring and yet another guest joining the squad.</p><p>So an enjoyable day ended with Cambridge South finishing runners up on goal difference in their group; a day marred by the behaviour of a couple of opposition players playing in a spirit not suited to an end of season festival. For the record, Felixstowe were defeated two-one in the final by Crane.</p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><b>Round</b></td><td><b>Opponents</b></td><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Result</b></td><td><b>Scorers</b></td></tr><tr><td>Pool</td><td>Braintree</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">3-2</td><td>Fleck, Riches, Williams</td></tr><tr><td>Pool</td><td>Bracknell</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">1-1</td><td>Craigen</td></tr><tr><td>Pool</td><td>Felixstowe</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">1-2</td><td><i>Guest</i></td></tr><tr><td>Pool</td><td>Bury St Edmunds<br></td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">0-0</td><td><br></td></tr></tbody></table>";NULL;NULL;"2005-04-20 13:07:14";"51";"1";"0";;"entry_detail.html";"0";"0";"0";"0";"1";"zinnia/_entry_detail.html"

Playing on an interestingly uneven grass pitch, the Southerners soon found themselves struggling defensively, due to their open attacking formation. A few attacks got into the opposition half but, mainly due to one of the Pirates' players being a full Kiwi international and a significantly higher standard than most others in the tournament, the ball was going past keeper Will Benedikz with depressing frequency. The closest the Southerners got to getting anything out of the game was when the match ball was lost in the nettles surrounding the pitch. Some of the teams better performances came from Linda Byrd and Rob Barton, who did their best to try and plug the leaks, and Shaun Hines, who looked solid in his second half defensive performance.</p><p>The only subjects for debate afterwards was whether the final score was seven, eight or nine-nil and, more importantly, when Mubashir would be arriving with lunch. The answer was about half twelve and, with other issues being conveniently glossed over, the Southerners squad tucked into the best food of any of the teams at the tournament. So good it ought to have won a trophy of some sort. Enough Chicken Biriyani, Raita and salad to sink a battleship, with the Stellas being passed about to wash it down beautifully.</p><p>With full stomachs, South headed over to the astroturf for the second match against the Red Hot Chillies, another of the Wisbech teams entered. A more even game ensued, with the Southerners taking a two-nil half time lead due to spectacular goals from Andy Lewis and Ian Black. For the first, Andy set-off on one of his trademark mazy runs. After beating all the opposition players, going back and beating them all again (twice), and with the South subs shaking their heads for the lack of the pass, Andy suddenly beat another man, burst into the D and fired a hard drive inside the far post. The second came from our best attacking move of the day. Wilco Dijkstra, Amy Forlin and Emma Cowan combined in midfield to get the ball to Blackie. His fierce drive from the tight angle again gave the keeper little chance. The lead was preserved by Mubashir, who had donned the keepers gear as an experiment, and proved himself with a number of important saves. Impressive play indeed, with Mubashir more impressed than anyone…</p><p>Encouraged (or scared) by the roaring and celebrating coming from behind, South set out to defend their lead with Helen Sams and Linda Byrd making good tackles in midfield in front of the back three of Andy King, John Benedikz and Jan Brynjolffssen. The defenders were trying to limit the amount of action Mubashir saw, to protect their eardrums if nothing else, and ultimately the Chillies were restricted to a single goal, turned in on the rebound from yet another save. A win, a win! The Southerners’ player of the match was clearly Mubashir for his outstanding performance, though credit must go to first time umpire Helen Benedikz for a valiant attempt, despite being handicapped by no knowledge of the commonly understood rules.</p><p>The next opponents were the Wild Geese (Pelicans of Kings Lynn), in what was a far more one-sided game than the final two-one scoreline suggests. Back on the undulating grass, the Southerners struggled to get much time on the ball. Even with Jim Thorpe doing another effective finger-in-the-dyke-job in central defence, the team relied on the ever-vocal Mubashir to keep them in contention. Which again he did spectacularly, no more so than a second half save with his left hand, high above his head, as a shot was rocketing towards the top corner.</p><p>The Wild Geese did find a way past once in each half but South struck back with our first and, as it would turn out, only shot of the game. John Benedikz won a ball in midfield and pushed it forward via Jayne King to Jim Thorpe. Jim beat two defenders before entering the circle. Will Benedikz poached the ball from the end of Jim's stick and drove it into the corner of the goal. When one final attack broke down, the game was over and then preparations for the evenings barbeque and drinking could begin…</p><p>Having washed down more food, once again produced by Mubashir, the evening began relaxing around the BBQ before moving to the bar and mobile disco thoughtfully provided by our hosts, and ultimately to cold sleeping bags. Moving swiftly on to morning, the cold light of day brought too much sunshine for some eyes but welcome warmth after a night under canvas.</p><p>The early start of bacon sarnies, tea and the occasional beer restored much faith in life and a gentle warm up for the day's games began. The Southerners faced local rivals Newmarket in their only game of the day.</p><p>The game started brightly and openly with South utilising one of the Wisbech keepers in order to free up their full outfield squad, and because they were deprived of Mubashir’s services for the day. South's bold game plan (a Christmas tree formation) failed to live up to expectations and despite some solid performances, including Andy King and Linda Byrd again making spirited contributions to the game in defence, South turned around a number of goals down.</p><p>During the second half John Benedikz moved back to help shore up the defence and it was one of his tackles that ultimately lead to the Southerners consolation goal. John passed forward to Rob Barton who immediately pushed the ball wide to Andy King at left-back. Andy ran forward and passed round a Newmarket attacker to set Amy Forlin free on the wing. Having drawn the defender she passed back to Andy who pushed the ball to Jayne King at centre forward. Jayne selflessly pulled the ball back to the top of the circle, past the final defender, for Will Benedikz to score into the open net.</p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/Wis%2003%20Nwmkt.jpg\" style=\"\"></p><p>By the time the final whistle went Newmarket had amassed five goals with just the single goal conceded, and all this without the aid of a keeper. The end of the game saw a very tired Southerners team leave the pitch.</p><p>A big 'thank you' to all those who made the effort to travel up for either one or both days. It was, again, a hugely enjoyable tournament and we look forward to heading north next season.</p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><b>Opponents</b></td><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Result</b></td><td><b>Scorers</b></td></tr><tr><td>Pirates</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">0-9</td><td><br></td></tr><tr><td>Red Hot Chillies</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">2-1</td><td>Lewis, Black</td></tr><tr><td>Wild Geese</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">1-2</td><td>W Benedikz</td></tr><tr><td>Newmarket</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">1-5</td><td>W Benedikz</td></tr></tbody></table><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/w03_07.jpg\" style=\"\"></p>";NULL;NULL;"2003-06-01 13:39:24";"53";"1";"0";;"entry_detail.html";"0";"0";"0";"0";"1";"zinnia/_entry_detail.html"

Or so it seemed. One or two players appeared more concerned with listening to the end of the England Rugby team's magnificent win over the All Blacks in New Zealand, than warming up for the action they were about to take part in. I know, as I was one of them. Jonny Wilkinson, a true English hero! Ahem…</p><p>Our first match was against the tournament hosts, Cambridge City. Despite some hard work, especially from the midfield of Amy Forlin, Andy Rose, Jenny Fleck and Ruth Fasham, we spent most of the game on the defensive, with City grabbing two deserved goals. Some nice moves were put together with the little possession we received, but without the ball there wasn’t much South could have done to force a different result.</p><p>Next up was what appeared our most winnable game of the day, against the Pretenders. After the somewhat sleepy start against City, it was important that more drive was put into the game and that was exactly what we saw. A very even match ensued with chances at both ends. South forwards Rob Barton and Andy Lewis had a few half sights of goal but unfortunately, the Pretenders goalkeeper proved too big an obstacle, and no rebound fell quite right for the South players following up. That said, at the other end the Pretenders had their chances, with keeper Will Benedikz called into sharp action on a couple of occasions to preserve South's point.</p><p>Still, some good stuff was played, especially in one flowing end-to-end move which began with sweeper John Benedikz, and passed on through right-back Dasa Brynjolffssen, midfielders Zoe Rose and Andy Rose before Barton saw his final shot smothered.</p><p>With a break until the next match and with the sun having just about got itself over the yardarm, it was time for the beers to appear. Only problem was no-one had brought a bottle opener with them. Eventually something best described as ‘a thingy on the netting surrounding the astro’ was found, with which the life-giving liquid could be extracted. Providing your chosen beverage hadn’t been shaken too hard before opening in which case, as Tim Poole and Dasa Brynjolffssen found, you received an early, beer-scented shower.</p><p>Onpwards and upwards, with the next match against a Cambs Nomads XI seeing South put on their best performance of the day. It was built on solid defence, well marshalled by Matt Bailey and Lynda Byrd, which allowed Steve Fleck to run the game from central midfield. The closest we came to scoring a deserved winner was when Jan Brynjolffssen was played down the byline by Fleck, from where he pulled the ball back across the face of goal. Emma Cowan had made an excellent run from her left midfield position to get onto the far post, but a covering defender just managed to get in front of her and get a touch on the ball to knock the cross away.</p><p>Despite our lack of a goal, South keeper Will Benedikz informed us afterwards that he hadn’t had a shot to save all match, which South took for a moral victory. However, with the tournament rules not recognising such a concept and only awarding one point for a goalless draw, South were now bottom of the pool with one match remaining, and that against the already-confirmed pool winners, the Pat Butchers.</p><p>South continued their good work from the Nomads game against their fancy dress-wearing opposition. After already going close once with a well worked short corner routine, South got the goal their play in the last two matches had earned. A good clean push out by John Benedikz and stop and switch from Steve Fleck gave Andy Rose the time to line up his shot. His flick of the ball towards the goalkeepers top left hand corner was only heading for one place. It did need a superb bit of evasive action by pusher-in Johnny B to arrive there, hitting the deck with alacrity to avoid heading Andy's shot clear. Snide observers could suggest that it was the sharpest John has moved for seasons, but that would be grossly unfair…</p><p>From that peak, the Butchers, in lovely floral dresses and wigs but also with not-so-lovely faux-Cockernee accents, began to take control. A strong performance by Tim Poole between the sticks kept the damage down to three, which was a very respectable result all told, though it did mean finishing fifth in the pool, which was a mite disappointing.</p><p>Overall an excellent day's hockey, which everyone thoroughly enjoyed. Thanks to Rob Barton for organising.</p><p>Cambridge South squad: Dasa Brynjolffssen, Lynda Byrd, Emma Cowan, Ruth Fasham, Jenny Fleck, Amy Forlin, Zoe Rose, Matt Bailey, Rob Barton, John Benedikz, Will Benedikz, Jan Brynjolffssen, Steve Fleck, Andy Lewis, Tim Poole, Andy Rose</p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><b>Opponents</b></td><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Result</b></td><td><b>Scorers</b></td></tr><tr><td>Cambridge City</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">0-2</td><td><br></td></tr><tr><td>Pretenders</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">0-0</td><td><br></td></tr><tr><td>Cambridge Nomads</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">0-0</td><td><br></td></tr><tr><td>Pat Butchers</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">1-3</td><td>Rose</td></tr></tbody></table>";NULL;NULL;"2003-06-16 13:53:05";"54";"1";"0";;"entry_detail.html";"0";"0";"0";"0";"1";"zinnia/_entry_detail.html"

The squad was augmented by two players from Cranes of Ipswich giving us very little ability to make substitutions.</p><p>This year the tournament had been expanded to two groups of five teams, with the winners of each group contesting the final. We were in a group with Bury St Edmunds, Bracknell, Clacton and Waveney, the team that beat us last year.</p><p>Our first game saw us with a maximum three points following a two-one win over Bury. Goals from Roman (from Cranes) and a superb individual one from Steve Fleck saw us home more comfortably than the scoreline indicates.</p><p>After an hour’s break we took to the field again to take on Bracknell. In a tough, evenly matched game Phil Smith scrambled a late goal following a cross from the right that flew up in the circle. So maximum points from our first two games and top of the league half way through the round-robin stage.</p><p>The next game was against Waveney and another tough struggle took place with neither attack able to break the other’s defence and a goalless draw resulted, with one point for each team.</p><p>Our final game, which was against Clacton, was the last one in the group and by now we knew that a win or a score draw would see us top the group and move into the final; whereas a win for Clacton would see them draw level with Waveney. So a hard fought game with everything to play for, for both teams. And hard fought it was, with the umpires having words with a couple of the Clacton players about language and conduct. Unfortunately our legs were tiring and the game resulted in yet another goalless draw.</p><p>So this meant that we tied with Waveney at the top of the group with eight points and the rules stipulated that the team scoring most goals went through to the final. As we had both scored 3 it came down to goals conceded and here Waveney scraped through having kept a clean sheet in every game. In the final, Waveney lost by a single goal to Marrssen from Holland.</p><p>And so the dream ended for another year; so near yet again. But still a great day was had by all in the sun with some good hockey being played.</p><p>Squad: Roy Todd, Steve Riches, Steve Garwood, Mike Gronow, Peter Mercer, Geoff Butcher, Piyush Yani, Phil Smith, Steve Fleck, Roger Craigen, and Geoff and Roman from Cranes.</p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><b>Round</b></td><td><b>Opponents</b></td><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Result</b></td><td><b>Scorers</b></td></tr><tr><td>Pool</td><td>Bury St Edmunds</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">2-1</td><td>Roman, Fleck</td></tr><tr><td>Pool</td><td>Bracknell</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">1-0</td><td>Smith</td></tr><tr><td>Pool</td><td>Waveney</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">0-0</td><td><br></td></tr><tr><td>Pool</td><td>Clacton</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">0-0</td><td><br></td></tr></tbody></table>";NULL;NULL;"2003-05-15 14:05:04";"55";"1";"0";;"entry_detail.html";"0";"0";"0";"0";"1";"zinnia/_entry_detail.html"

Cambridge South managed to scrape together seven players, unlike most other teams there that had two or three substitutes.</p><p>Cambridge South were drawn in a group with Cranes, last years champions, Clacton, Norfolk Nomads and Waveney; with the other pool comprising Felixstowe, Braintree, Bracknell, Uccle from Brussels and Bury.</p><p>Nomads were our first opponents and a very disappointing performance saw us defeated two-one. Some sloppy play saw the opposition score two soft goals in the first ten minutes before South woke up from the 8.30 departurte from Cambridge! In spite of some good attacking play for the last ten minutes of the twenty-five minute game, the Nomads keeper made numerous excellent saves to deny the powerful attack of Dave Maynard and Roger Craigen. In fact, it was Colin Worboys pushing up from defence who scored setting up a frantic last few minutes but their keeper denied us an equalising goal.</p><p>After a break we played Clacton and South were again slow to start but the defence held firm with Lino making several good saves when the two main defenders in front of him, Steve Riches and Colin Worboys were beaten. South dominated much of the game, with most of the team spending the majority of the time in the oppositions half. However another excellent game from a keeper thwarted most of South's efforts and it was another defender who scored. This time Steve Riches saw his scuffed shot beat a stranded keeper for the only goal of the match.</p><p>After an hour's break we played against Waveney who had beaten all the other three teams they had played against. So this was a must win match for South; a win or draw for Waveney would see them safely top of the group and move into the final. South started with all players linking up well and dominating the opening ten minutes. The midfield of Stephen Fleck and David Bridge controlled the centre of the pitch and set up numerous moves for the front two to capitalise on. From one flowing move down the right Dave Maynard beat two defenders after being set free by the ever-energetic Stephen Fleck before slotting home under a diving keeper. This goal was immediately followed up by a similar move down the left. Colin moved the ball to David Bridge who beat his man and then passed to Roger. His fierce shot, after dummying his marker, from the edge of the circle took a slight deflection off a defenders stick to fly past Waveney's stranded keeper.</p><p>These two goals brought the opposition to life. They pushed forward and with the help of fresher legs that their subs gave them managed to bring the game level with five minutes to go. South fought back and a fierce shot from Dave pinged off the far post with the defence well beaten. South kept pushing forward and from a short corner Dave struck home the winning goal just before the whistle went.</p><p>Half an hour to rest and regroup before our final game which was also a must win after opening the group up with the win against the group leaders. If Cambridge South or Cranes, our final opponents, could win four-nil then they were in the final. Unfortunately this proved to be an unfriendly game and a very aggressive Cranes side were not taking any prisoners. After a couple of early shots from the South front pair, Cranes dominated the match and were three goals up with ten minutes to go. By now tempers were getting frayed and the young umpire had lost control. From a fierce rising shot Lino went down in agony - a box doesn't offer sufficient protection. Play was held up for five minutes while he recovered and the opposition moaned about would enough time be added on. Lino recovered enough to hobble off the pitch and we called on the services of Waveney's keeper to take his place.</p><p>From the restart, South had a couple of shots on goal but from a swift break from defence, one of Cranes' forwards managed a shot as he was being challenged by Colin. A shout of \"leave it\" went out and the keeper did just that. Cranes claimed a goal, South disputed it but somehow the umpire, who was near the halfway line, managed to clearly see that the ball was inside the circle!</p>Cranes then brought all players into their half for the final few minutes and with South not wishing to really challenge for 50-50 balls against an aggressive team, Cranes won by the four goals required and went into the final, which unfortunately they won two-one.</p><p>However, an enjoyable day out and to finish it off two of the squad also backed the third horse in The National! It was also a memorable day to mark the retirement of Roger Craigen, the club's President and Vets captain.</p><p>Squad: Lino Di Lorenzo , Steve Riches, Colin Worboys, Stephen Fleck, David Bridge, Dave Maynard and Roger Craigen.</p>";NULL;NULL;"2007-04-15 16:53:04";"56";"1";"0";;"entry_detail.html";"0";"0";"0";"0";"1";"zinnia/_entry_detail.html"

(Spent the whole night on cider. What a legend.)</p><hr><p>After narrow defeats for the M2s and M3s on the field, there was a clear need for a couple of medicinal pints to speed recovery. Fortunately the 1st team's crushing 3-0 win over Spalding (taking the first points of the season from that team) meant that spirits were running high enough for all.</p><p>Proceedings got off to a faltering start as it was discovered that the Salisbury Arms wasn't actually opening until 6pm that day but fortunately only one early arrival, the eager Mr J Bridge, was left beating his fists at the door for five minutes, as even earlier arrivals Messers Thorpe and Lockhart had since retired to the nearby Six Bells for emergency rehydration.</p><p>Once the doors finally opened the release of tension was audible and let's just say that no more time was wasted. Gradually numbers built and ambient noise grew as the day's exploits were retold with ever decreasing factual content. Head count got as high as about twenty at one point, making the evening the most successful hockey social since the annual dinner.</p><p>Shots came thicker and faster, passes got slicker and tackles got harder (as is the way with so many good nights out after hockey matches) and backs were generally given a good and proper slapping.</p><p>Once the team was assembled and well oiled, some of them were swiftlyintroduced to the Ring Game. Rick \"Frodo\" Erlebach demonstrated a particular aptitude for hooking his ring. Apparently \"you can swing both ways\". (For those who have bothered to read this far and are wondering exactly what this all entails it would be far simpler if you went along to the Salisbury Arms one quiet evening and whispered casually to the barman \"I've heard you do the Ring Game…\")</p><p>No good hockey social would be complete without the traditional feed, so next it was on to the Curry Queen. A table for sixteen worked nicely and so did a similar number of Lal Toofan's and about four dozen poppadoms. Sanjay Mathos, with all the authority of authentic Indian heritage, explained at length how it was far better to eat Byrianis and Chipatis so of course it was jalfrezis, tikka massalas, korma's, pilau rice and naan bread all round.</p><p>That's where your narrator starts to lose the plot slightly. The official hockey social disbanded but there was definitely a rum and coke, three cans of lager, a helping of vodka jelly and a bona fide lunar eclipse involved at one point or another.</p><p>Thanks to all who were able to come.

This season has seen the formation of a new Men's 5th XI as well as record numbers in the Ladies' teams. After two seasons of settling in at Long Road, the obvious next step for Cambridge South was the establishment of a Juniors section.</p><p>Interest in hockey in Cambridge has continued to grow at all levels, with particular demand for Junior hockey. Encouraged and supported by <a href=\"http://www.livingsport.co.uk/\">Living Sport</a>, the community sports partnership for Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, and the East regional office of <a href=\"http://www.east-hockey.com/\">England Hockey</a>, Cambridge South has decided to start a club Juniors section to help meet this demand.</p><p>The Junior sessions are based around the Quicksticks form of the game, aimed at introducing young players to the sport. As Cambridge South Juniors grows, our intention is to introduce older age groups for players age 13+, including club teams playing against other junior sides, ultimately providing a pathway into senior club hockey.</p><p>We want our Junior players and their families feel like a full part of Cambridge South Hockey Club, building a long term relationship with the club, with junior players progressing into senior teams and, who knows, maybe junior parents progressing into umpires and coaches!</p><p>For more information about Cambridge South Junior Hockey, see our <a href=\"https://www.cambridgesouthhockeyclub.co.uk/juniors/\">Juniors</a> page.</p>";NULL;NULL;"2016-10-25 19:30:10";"58";"1";"0";;"entry_detail.html";"0";"0";"0";"0";"1";"zinnia/_entry_detail.html"

With the hours in between thegame and the party bridged by pizza and an additional pub session, just because,well, you know, Christmas!!!!</em></p><p>Yes, there was an excellent crowd for the game prior to this. The L3s had a fantastic match against the Nomads L2s, narrowly losing 0-1 against well organised opponents. It was very entertaining to watch and, as Jan's report states, probably the most important thing to focus on/take from the fixture that followed.</p><p>Oh, and curiosity led me to check out the definition of 'Motley';</p><p><i>adjective</i></p><p>adjective: <b>motley</b>; comparative adjective: <b>motlier</b>; superlative adjective: <b>motliest</b></p><p></p><ol><li>incongruously varied in appearance or character; disparate.<p></p><p><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\">\"a motley crew of discontents</span></strong> and zealots\"</p></li></ol><p>*I always find using the dictionary a slippery slope, as the descriptive words used to describe the word you are looking up are also sophisticated, leading you to then have to look that word up, and then the following descriptive words for that word. I have just spent the last thirty minutes learning what 'motley', 'zealot', 'theocracy', 'ecclesiocracy' and 'deity' all mean.</p><p>Jan's pre-match summary was therefore nearly accurate. However (due to some brilliant organisation), Dani's Santa team were supplied with matching Santa hats, and Colin's Elfs were donning the more elaborate Elf hats (inclusive of ears) that made everyone look very uniform and festive.</p><p>The first half was the better of the two halves. The Santas took an early lead through the Engine scoring. Hazel then levelled for the Elfs and then the Santas scored again through a good bit of composure in the D by Rich. The Elfs levelled through Lauren and it was two-two at half time. The team selection was based on who I thought in the men's list had an old green shirt and who was too new to the club and only had the replacement purple shirts. It had nothing to do with making the teams even but at half time I was thinking this team selection was luckily just that.</p><p>The second half was not so even and the Santa's scored a further three times through the Engine (who completed his hat trick) and Wizard. The final score was 5-2.</p><p>It chucked it down the whole match and everyone got soaked but it was still great fun. Even the two umpires (Jack and Steve) were loving the event and were provided with festive hats (albeit I have now established that Jack hates hats).</p><p>My highlight of the day was getting a lift in Simon's Lotus Elise, although getting in and out of the car with two big soaking wet kit bags was somewhat challenging.</p><p>The match photo was taken at half time when the score was level and everyone was in a festive mood (in my opinion the best faces to look for in the photo belong to Howard, Rich, Harry and Wizard);</p><p><strong>FINAL SCORE<br>Santas 5 - 2 Elfs</strong></p><p>Scorers: <u>Santas</u> - Ali Edge (3), Rich Hollidge, Oli Lamming; <u>Elfs</u> - Hazel Polge, Lauren Brown</p><p>MoM: Ali Edge - Scored a hat trick, but more crucially purchased a jug of beer because of this, securing crucial MOM votes. :)</p><p>LoM: Colin T - Every time I get the ball people are shouting 'aerial, aerial'.

The Panton Arms was transformed into a veritable Winter Wonderland to host a fantastic turnout of Southerners including more than one surviving member of the earlier \"Elfs\" vs Santas battle. Yes that's right, Elfs not elves; Colin prefers Elfs to the more grammatically correct Elves. With a few other rearranged fixtures taking place there were many other weather weary and battle worn veterans bedecked in the most Christmassy of jumpers. From the incredible range on show, special mentions for Simon Jelley's Happy Christmas set of wearable lights and Lou Cantwell's fantastically detailed jumper. As with most South Socials, it was never going to be a Silent Night.&nbsp;</p><p>Oh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree! Oh dear me what a selection box of Yuletide branches there were on offer. The task: create a decorated Christmas tree from only some crepe paper and a willing volunteer. Let snow-body say that Southerners aren't creative or inventive, or at the very least enthusiastic. The pressure was immense and the crepe paper both fragile and flammable. The atmospheric candles dotted around the room were an extra challenge to overcome, but happily there were no serious burns. Some creations even looked like Christmas trees by the end. Although, let's face it some were rather creepy and others swathed in so many adornments that they were immobile (queue petitions to the judges for disqualification). There were difficulties in establishing what a star looks like but in the end, who doesn't love a game of stick the bauble on the model, eh? Modelled by Izzy, Team 10's elegant effort marshalled by Ellie nabbed the bounty (included as part of the Celebrations). Sweets for all, or coal for some?</p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/Party1.jpg\" style=\"\"></p><br><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/George.jpg\" style=\"\"></p><p>Which brings us to the matter of who’s been naughty and who’s been nice this year? Well this elf on the shelf was making a list and checking it twice. In a heroic effort to save Hazel's hair from certain destruction, Kath's Kat-like reflexes ensured her place on the Nice list. Initially dominated by a confirmation of the Nice qualities of the L2s squad, Shin was the sole entry on the Naughty list for some time due to \"interesting\" Google search suggestions (NSFW link not supplied). However, as if by Elvish magic (or Gúl for LOTR fans) suspicious additions to the Naughty list began to appear...</p><p>There was no possible way of tracing the author(s) as s/he seems to have cleverly masked their handwriting with a childish scrawl, which could alternatively have been written by a right-handed person's left hand; genius. Not even a Sherlock Christmas special would crack this riddle. Graham's name made an appearance on the Nice side, but for reasons unknown this entry was eventually crossed out. Conflicting entries for Jack on both lists confused many who struggled to recall instances of Niceness this year. From the comments he seems simultaneously to be the worst and best manager the L2s have ever had (point of information; he currently leads the L2s lemon votes this year). Joining him on the Naughty side were Chris Pearson for \"standard reasons\", Colin (unsure why, I don't remember any aerials in the pub?), Eimear (reasons too many to mention), Dani, and despite his absence, or perhaps as a consequence of his absence, Paresh. But as Shin pointed out, coal is actually quite a useful gift during winter in Cambridge. Bah Humbug.</p><p>No stockings were hung by the chimney with care but I predict that Pay and Play is going to be even more vibrant than usual next week with an onslaught of cow, sheep, rubber duck, and space invaders themed footwear emerging from the bags of Secret Santa surprises. To the relief of many, no smelly socks were detected in the lucky dip and all seemed to be new pairs although quite why a pair of discarded purple definitely not new CSHC socks appeared on a table a little later remains unclear. Perhaps the neon pink ones were preferred to South's own purple; perhaps we should change the kit again!</p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/IMG_3496.JPG\" style=\"\"></p><p>All I Want For Christmas is... a shot of Sambucca. Said no one ever. Finishing up in the Regal, a few Die Hard revellers Jingle Bell Rock-ed out, dancin' and prancin' the night away, cementing their Naughty or Nice statuses. But what happens in the Regal is hard to recall accurately the next day, so you’ll have to be there yourself next time to witness it all.</p><p>Huge thanks to Meg and Ali for all their hard work in organising a fantastic night, and to the Panton for having us.</p><p>Merry Christmas, Everyone.</p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/Party2.jpg\" style=\"\"></p>";NULL;NULL;"2016-12-12 23:21:41";"61";"1";"0";;"entry_detail.html";"0";"0";"0";"0";"1";"zinnia/_entry_detail.html"

Another big thank you to our two keepers on the second evening, providing an exciting penalty flick contest.</p><p>The events of the evening, as seen by the captains…</p><p><strong>Ev’rything’s Coming Up Dusty – Captain Harry Chalk (Contenders for the CSHC Fair Play Award 2017)</strong></p><p><i>Ev’rything’s Coming Up Dusty</i> took to the pitch, determined that everyone playing would enjoy the club tournament. When we say 'everyone', we mean everyone, and duly awarded victory to the majority of our opponents to make sure they were having a good time. The main highlight was, however, beating eventual finalists, team <i>Judge Dr.eddge</i>, with some really excellent team hockey. We were congratulated for our selfless attitude with the Wooden Spoon and continue to hope we are strong contenders for the CSHC Fair Play Award 2017. <i>(Ed: Bonus mention for the esteemed captain managing an illegal aerial play due to his politely asking, ‘Can I do an aerial please?’)</i></p><p><strong>The Spartans – Captain Janette Murphy</strong></p><p>Here it is! The email with the team lists for club night (or nights, as the case maybe this year). Oh, the excitement: whose team will I be on this time? Wait, hang on a sec, what’s this… Black team, Spartans, captain…ME! What, no! This can’t be right. WHY? Just WHY……… Oh well, time to get on and suck it up, and kudos to my team mates, we did very well indeed (first night at least). So much so that Jack, stunned by our skill, had to throw himself at our feet during the game! Of course, must give a shout out to Dave for his spectacular javelin style of defending, highlight of the evening for us Spartans.</p><p>We will quickly gloss over the second evening; it was hot, some of us were tired (some of us attended Pay and Play on Wednesday - not a good idea!) and only one sub, and that was only for one game. I’m not bitter, it’s all gooooood :) All in all, a fab time was had over both nights.</p><p><strong>I Cancelled My Haircut for This – Captain Shin Kim</strong></p><p>What a difference two days can make! On day one, we had a torrid three games, losing each and every one of them. Despite scoring our fair share of goals, we ended with a goal difference of -10 and bottom of the table. However, with a couple of new arrivals and a dubious team substitution following an injury to the third lady in our team, we mustered two wins against our fellow bottom-of-the-table dwellers in our final round-robin games, which brought us up to an almighty fourth. The fun didn't end there, as we entered in to the 3rd vs 4th playoff match for the hypothetical bronze medal. Ending one-one after a game played in good spirit, we took to flicks and came out victors.</p><p>TL;DR - After Day 1, we were last, but after Day 2, we came third overall. Hockey is a game of two halves, after all.</p><p><strong>Having a Ball – Captain Ellie Edwards (winners of the People’s Choice Award)</strong></p><p>So the Blues had a great day. With a mix of old and new members, it took us a few matches to get into our stride but when we did we were on fire! With our final match against the Pinks, we came out victorious, not only for that match but the whole of Club Night as champs (#alternativefacts)! Well deserved, Blue team!</p><p><strong>I am the Law-ra – Captain Laura Edge (Champions)</strong></p><p>The yellow team had the amazing luck to split neatly into a group of seven committed souls, keen to remain on the pitch and fully embrace the last of the season’s hockey competition. The remaining team members found Club Night the perfect opportunity to ensure that the social commitments of Club Night were fulfilled.</p><p>With halftime sweets on both evenings, the strategy came together perfectly, especially when George got into his stride and started to try and chat with opposition players on the pitch. The second evening started with flies swarming around the yellow bibs, reminding us all that summer had definitely arrived.

Nonetheless, I’d had my champers on ice since the late morning and nothing was going to stop me. I popped in for a couple of cheeky pre-drinks with the girls, <i>chez Muzza</i>, whose playlist was banging. Nothing like the Ghostbusters theme to get the night off to a good start. Kim arrived (late, as per) with a whole bottle of Pimm’s and a Tupperware full of chopped cucumber. Stressing that it was for everyone to share, no one else seemed to get near it. Oh well. Ellie trod on her foot in revenge so that made up for it a bit.</p><p>Lucy Cavendish awaited and I was desperate to get my hands on my eighth glass of Prosecco. After a short delay on the red carpet for some group photographs in front of resident paparazzo, Harry Chalk, we rushed up to the bar to grab some much-needed wine. Hadn’t had a drink for at least seven minutes. Everyone crowded round the seating plan, anxious to discover their fate. I was surprised and honoured to have made the naughty table, having heard about the controversial seating split in 2016. I went and found my seat, and comfortably nestled myself in between Hazza and the Viscount. Fashionably late having stopped off to get his hair cut in London en route, Lord of the Manor, Shin, arrived with three bottles of whisky.</p><p>We tucked into the first course, and it wasn’t long before the Viscount was up to his old tricks – throwing his money around left, right and centre. Georgie Howling started giggling. Robyn Murray, demure as ever, casually chucked back most of a bottle of wine. More pennies flew. Tom and Ellie took some interesting photos. I decided to escalate things by trying to return the favour and penny the Viscount by inserting said coin, wine and glass in one go into his glass. Somehow, my attempt to defy the laws of physics failed. Hazza was left holding the stem.</p><p>It was about this time, at approximately 9.23 pm, shortly after I had picked up my award for Best Newcomer of the Season, that I decided the time was right to conduct a full and detailed inspection of the tiling pattern in the college facilities.</p><p><i>[Some minutes passed]</i></p><p>‘Purple to…er…purple’, I muttered under my breath between gags, joining the dots between the blurry colours in the tiles on the bathroom floor (or was that the red wine Pollock-inspired mural I installed in the cubicle a few minutes earlier?!) ‘Keep calm and carry on’, reassured Amalia, as she patted my shoulder and held on to my hair. Through the hazy, white light I saw a vision coming towards me. Coming to rescue me from this tiled purgatory approached a black and silver chariot. I staggered on to my feet and into its welcoming cushioned comfort, which whisked me out into the cool, refreshing (slightly damp) Cambridge night.</p><hr><h2>2nd half</h2><p><i>By <a href=\"https://www.cambridgesouthhockeyclub.co.uk/members/515/\">Simon Cooper</a></i></p><p><b><i>Meanwhile, in another part of Cambridge…</i></b></p><p>I’d spent an enjoyable couple of hours at Jim and Katie’s wedding when the call came through. Anticipating exactly this, I had taken the precaution of leaving my phone at home but Meg had managed to reach me via everyone’s favourite nice small man, Graham.</p><p>‘Coops’, she said, in strained tones. ‘Ali and I are struggling. It was a mistake to put Rosselli and Howling in charge of the naughty table and the evening is already threatening to spill out of control. Please, can you help?’</p><p>Sighing, I carefully put down my slice of cake, a half-empty glass of Prosecco and Xabi’s mum. What the club needs, I will always give.</p><p>One completely safe and proper cycle ride later, I arrived at Lucy Cavendish College to see Robyn McLean departing in something of a hurry. There was sadly no time to show concern for her welfare though, as the low rumble coming from a subterranean banqueting suite suggested that the eating had finished and it was time for the public-speaking competition. I mean, the speeches and awards.</p><p>The well-honed Greaves/Steed double-act opened proceedings, with a performance more than vaguely reminiscent of the Two Ronnies in their pomp. This was swiftly followed by Jan’s impressively comprehensive statistical explanation of his squad’s Div 5 success and Laura’s heartfelt description of the L3s’ improvement. At this stage, it was bizarrely Joe Whittaker that stretched out a healthy lead in both the Men’s and Ladies’ awards, until it became clear that he was, by and large, collecting trophies on behalf of others by public demand.</p><p>Next, it was my turn. I got off to a good start by pennying Sneade on my way up to the stage, but then disaster struck. ‘I think you’ll all agree with me that the bride looks truly lovely…’, I began. Oops. Wrong speech! I descended into Tom Anns-bashing in desperation, which would have got a much better reception if most of the people there had known who he was.</p><p>Dani got proceedings back on track before Pearson predictably put a torch under them again with his typically well-prepared effort. Engine (Ali) was fortunately on hand to become Fire Engine and rescue the situation before handing over to Lou C and Sophie. They’d obviously had a great season, smashing up Div 1, and judging by the variety of customised T-shirts that were distributed, I think they’d celebrated largely by buying half of Primark.</p><p>So, without too much fuss, the speeches were over and we could head to the bar to hear more about George Toynton’s elaborate watersports plans.</p><p>Uh oh. The chairman had one of those glints in his eye and, more importantly, four pages of text in his left hand. How had I forgotten the most important awards of all?!</p><p>Special mention was appropriately given to the umpires who had spent their year doing their best to coax the odd spell of hockey from each of us, before John moved on to the prestigious Club Man and Club Lady of the Season. Ali Edge and Lou Cantwell collected their awards to suitable acclaim. Jack was then unfortunate to be such collateral damage in Dani’s receipt of a very excellent Mick Beasley Trophy.</p><p>Finally though, to the bar! It was probably a good idea that this was only being sporadically manned by a solitary barmaid, as that at least placed a practical limit on what could be purchased and imbibed. Even so, there was plenty of wheelchair, piano and kilt-based shenanigans before we all disgorged into the cold midnight air. This natural blast of realism affected people in different ways. Some simply went home, often in the company of nervous-looking taxi drivers. A few limped to The Maypole. The majority raced to Fez Club, which Shin promptly purchased in its entirety. He's a good egg. Without mentioning any names, I hear that nudity was only marginally avoided in not just one but two cabs en route – phew! A year with South can be liberating in more than one way, apparently.</p><p>Ladies and Gentlemen, can I ask you to raise your glasses?</p><h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>'To the Bride and Groom!'</i></h3><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/18221917_10100408210412092_5168000772136007734_n.jpg\" style=\"\"></p>";NULL;NULL;"2017-05-04 11:03:39";"64";"1";"0";;"entry_detail.html";"0";"0";"0";"0";"1";"zinnia/_entry_detail.html"

Oh - and hockey!</p>";"ely-tournament-2017";"<p>The car was filled with an inflatable mattress, two cool boxes, a gazebo, several crates of beer and cider, camping chairs, personalised T-shirts, vacuum-packed duvet, a cardboard shell and a papier-maché star: this can only mean one thing…Ely weekend!!</p><p>Everyone woke early on Saturday morning and managed to make it to Ely on time. This in itself is an accomplishment as usually someone is late or forgets to turn up to a mixed fixture (I think everyone was pretty excited for this one). Graham even arrived early and had already erected the Palace by 9am. T-shirts were dished out and the two South teams, Sega Mega Drive and Nintendo 64, got stuck in!</p><p>Saturday saw both teams complete in five matches against the likes of Ely, St Ives, Pelicans and City. The most entertaining match of that day was the South-on-South fixture. Not wanting anyone to feel left out, we decided the entirety of both squads would take to the pitch in a pay and play-style brawl (and I managed to get my own back on Colin for the last mixed match and clinch the win).</p><p>Between matches we lounged at base camp (several years of attending this tournament has taught us well, for our base camp was complete with a gazebo - with another one to spare - windbreaker, speaker and ice bucket for beers). By the close of play on Saturday, both teams had played well enough to make it into the Shield play-off the next day. With all the hockey done and dusted for the day, we brought out the garden games and cards, and cracked open another crate.</p><p>The theme of the weekend this year was 'Back to the 90s' and we had decided our teams' costumes would revolve around Mario Kart (released in 1992 for those who are interested). I couldn't have been more impressed with the Southerners' efforts, we had such a variety of brilliant costumes that people had lovingly made and spent time on. There was only one thing for it…race time! As the sun set and we failed at yet another round of Shin's difficult Korean drinking game it was time to head in to the club house for the famous Ely disco. The music was all from the 90s and the DJs gave each team their moment in the limelight by playing the theme music for each group's costumes, including Britney, Toy Story, Rosie and Jim, and of course the Mario theme tune.</p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EkqnVzO64aU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><p>It was safe to say the next morning we were all slightly the worse for wear! The combination of Smirnoff Ice, Cactus Jacks, Jäger, loud rain and chilly conditions was obvious on the faces of everyone at breakfast. Nevertheless, we pulled ourselves together, put on our damp and stinky playing kits and went out in the sun for another great day of hockey! Battered, bruised, sleep-deprived and sunburnt, we somehow managed to make it all the way to the finals of the Shield with Nintendo 64 claiming fourth and Sega Mega Drive taking second place.</p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/WhatsApp%20Image%202017-05-15%20at%2018.52.07.jpeg\" style=\"\"><br><br><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/WhatsApp%20Image%202017-05-15%20at%2018.52.41.jpeg\"><br><br><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/WhatsApp%20Image%202017-05-15%20at%2018.52.23.jpeg\" style=\"\"></p><p>Take home moments from Ely 2017…</p><ul><li><p>Chumbawumba's hit from the 90s, 'Tubthumping' is an absolute thigh killer if you actually get down and get up again (my fault, sorry)</p></li><li><p>Stick on tattoos are realllly hard to get off and will result in curiously shaped tan lines</p></li><li><p>Jelley can not only break into cars but can also make one in a weekend and two evenings with some plastic tubing and a 3D printer</p></li><li><p>It's hard to dance with a star-shaped sandwich board without causing some minor injuries</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6lkky\">Mölkky</a> is hard</p></li><li><p>It's easy to lose a mouthguard in socks and make everyone else look for it</p></li><li><p>We are awesome at chanting</p></li><li><p>Suncream is important</p></li><li><p>Bananas can helicopter</p></li><li><p>Graham won the Fitbit weekend warrior challenge with an impressive 58,762 steps</p></li><li><p>Don't trip Harry up, ever!</p></li></ul><p>What an amazing weekend!!

Forget the summer solstice, the new start of summer begins when this tournament reaches its conclusion…</p><p><strong>The Cup Final - Purple to Purple v S.T.I…ves (final score 2-7)</strong><br>Woah! I was expecting a close game, but S.T.I…ves brought their ‘A' game and smashed this year’s debutants. That’s ten wins from ten over two tournaments for the mighty St Ives; they will be the team everyone wants to beat next time around. Robyn should be pleased with how far her team of hotshots got though. It wasn’t all doom and gloom for her last weekend, as she led almost the same squad of players (same-ish name anyway) to victory at the Saffron Walden Bailey Cup on Saturday, albeit they were playing in green and the team was therefore aptly named ‘Purple to Green’.</p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/St%20Ives.jpg\" style=\"\"></p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/P2P.jpg\" style=\"width: 50%;\"><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/Bailey%20Cup.jpg\" width=\"200\" style=\"width: 50%;\" title=\"Yes, that is some quality silverware – we need to discuss getting a trophy cabinet at the next committee meeting!\"></p><p><strong>The Plate Final – SWXLS v TFI Thursday (final score 3-4)</strong><br>YEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!! We pulled it off again!!!! A tactical masterclass (if I may say so myself). Who’d have thought a Loss, Win, Loss, Draw and Win would have been enough in any sort of competition to take home the goods?</p><p>A great final against our brand new arch-rivals, SWXLS. We gave them a taste of their own medicine with a ringer in the form of some German guy called Julius, who scored all our goals in the final (despite my specific instructions to Neil to tell him to keep a low profile at the back). The scoring went 1-0, 1-1, 1-2, 2-2, HT, 2-4, 3-4 and with about fifteen minutes to go a new phenomenon occurred that will be forever known as ‘Doing a Sneady’, where he kept the ball in his own half back left corner. He’s probably picked that up from watching some international football but the difference being those antics usually begin in injury time, not with half the game still to go!</p><p>Nev – if you want to complain about our ringer then I’m not sure who to direct you to?! The Police, perhaps?! Hang on – I AM THE POLICE!?</p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/Plate%20champions.jpg\" style=\"\"></p><p><strong>3rd Place Play off – C-Bombs and G-Strings v That Chocolate Lot (final score 6-1)</strong><br>The C-Bombs would have been gutted to have missed out on the final, but it was yet another convincing win for them to come third in the competition. Congratulations to ‘Only Here for the Chocolate Medals’ who can also be classed as winners, having achieved their objective by turning up to finals night in great numbers to get their hands on the confectionary. Next year, you could just skip 5 x 40 minutes of hockey and the £100 team entry fee and go online and order your own chocolate medals.</p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/OHFTCM.jpg\" style=\"\"></p><p><strong>Wooden Spoon – 4Tress (that’s as short as I can get it) v Long Road Longbows (final score 2-2: pens 0-2)</strong><br>What a match! Yet another score draw and a penalty shoot-out. The Fortress pulled it off to win that wooden spoon in an epic encounter. I wasn’t there and Neil was in charge of the medals and silverware so I am wondering whether there was actually a wooden spoon handed over, and can you get a wooden spoon engraved? It’s actually the most practical of awards and can be stowed away in a drawer, unlike a trophy that will just clutter up a study or fireplace, so from that perspective it is actually the best award to win, surely?? Lou – if you did get handed this please just leave it alone in the drawer so that it is in good working order for next year.</p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/Fortress.jpg\" style=\"\"></p><p><strong>My 5 best moments of the tournament:</strong></p><p><ol><li>Putting George ‘One Job’ Toynton in charge of the hooter.

However, there are some occasions that demand that an exception be made. The M3s’ trip to Norwich City’s Pre-Season 7-a-side Tournament was such an occasion.</p><p>The award was sealed (very) early doors by, of course, Will Jones. Having gamely and slightly surprisingly signed up for a tournament that started at 10am in Norwich, Will either hadn’t realised where Norwich was or hadn’t realised when 10am was. The end result was the same: when captain Matt knocked on Will’s door at a brisk 7.45 on a Sunday morning, he was answered not by Will clad in his hockey kit but by Will’s mum clad in her nightie. She explained that Will had had a bit of a ‘big night’ and had ‘lost his phone’. Yeesssss… One man down and it wasn’t even 8am.</p><p>Matt’s next call was me. I have to confess that I, too, was not feeling at my most sprightly. Graham’s selfish decision to move to Thailand, holding his leaving drinks the night before the tournament, compounded by Shin inconsiderately buying everyone champagne, had not proved the ideal preparation. Waking at 2am, I was worried by how drunk I still felt but figured I had another five hours or so to sleep it off. At 4.30am, I was definitely less drunk but I can’t say the prospect of a drive to Norwich and a whole day’s hockey in another few hours was filling me with joy. By 7am though, I was probably almost sober, and stoically hauled myself out of bed to make a bowl of krispies and a thermos of tea before my lift arrived.</p><p>The journey up was interrupted by a stop at Maccy D’s near Thetford, where the one-way system totally baffled Matt as we ignored two no-entry and one no-right-turn signs. Inside, the rest of the M3s and the L1s were already tucking into their pancakes and Egg McMuffins. Spirits were good in both teams, despite the early start, and I was also feeling better after alarge coffee. Maybe this wouldn’t be so bad after all.</p><p>Arriving in Norwich (actually Taverham) for 10am, we discovered that our first opponents, UEA 2, had pulled out and consequently we had no game until 11.30 - a whole hour in bed lost! South base camp was already being established by the L1s, who were impressively organised - waterproof ground rugs, camping chairs, homemade sausage rolls, etc. The M3s had turned upwith a packet of Tangfastics. There was apparently a water-based astro and a sand astro but, having inspected both pitches, we were hard put to tell which was which. There certainly weren’t going to be any spectacular sliding dives, not for anyone who fancied keeping their skin anyway. While we waited for our first game, we watched the ladies’ opening fixtures. Their first three matches were frustrating, a series of late goals turning promising results into a draw and two defeats but it was upward for them from there.</p><p>The M3s were playing in the competition for teams from Divisions 3 and 4. Having just gone up to Div 4, we were expecting a testing time, and so it proved. Our tournament got off to a positive start as we held Saffron Walden 3s to a goalless draw. Dropout Will had been replaced by Oli Lamming, originally along to support Hannah in the L1s but now finding himself draftedinto the M3s' squad. Fortunately, OIi never travels anywhere without his stick bag and full playing kit. Matt had decided on a 2-3-1 formation, with the nine outfielders divided into groups of three players for two positions, each group rotating every four or five minutes. Now ten minutes of hockey per game doesn’t sound a lot, but 7-a-side is brutal in its intensity and we were all very glad of a full squad. George in goal, despite being the only player getting a full game, was shamelessly renting himself out to any team who would have him, dashing from one match to another. Such a hockey ho.</p><p>Next up were Ipswich &amp; East Suffolk 2s and another tight match. Having gone a goal behind, we equalised through Alex P before, imitating our L1 counterparts, conceding an agonising late winner. That set the pattern for the day - two further one goal defeats in close games, including a winner from Seahawks that saw a speculative aerial thrown forward, bounce and be lobbed over George. Seahawks were left hanging on, delaying at every opportunity (resulting in some words from the umpire), but we were unable to recover the goal in time.</p><p>We were consistently competitive, only being properly put away by Norwich City 5s in a 4-0 defeat, but lacking a bit of cutting edge, as shown by our absence of further goals, and game management, meaning any concession invariably proved decisive. The match against Norwich Dragons included some spectacular saves, with George taking one full in the grill and yours truly blocking goal-bound shots out of the air (one of which frustratingly deflected straight to another Dragons striker who coudn’t miss) including one high clearance of another lobbed ball that was dropping behind George and under the crossbar, which saw me voted Man of the Tournament (thanks, guys!) but wasn’t enough to save a 2-0 defeat.</p><p>On the positive side, we regularly made good use of space and new man, Dom, looks like he'll be a valuable addition to the team, with sensible clearances and even the occasional aerial. In other incidents of note, Joe showed off his 3D skills (badly) with Haribo, Flix was almost taken out by a baseball, Dom got angry in a very non-Southerner manner but reminiscent of other-Dom N (is it something about being called Dom?), Chris felt ill after eating a burger and Kim asked Joe’s permission to feel his chest. And we also had the L1s to cheer on, who rallied to finish with a 3-3-3 record and a mid-table position in the Ladies’ Premier competition, having won the Ladies’ Higher tournament last year.</p><p>By 4pm we were well and truly spent and glad to depart ahead of the threatening rain, leaving the L1s to play their last fixture. A testing but worthwhile experience, and a good day out.</p>";NULL;NULL;"2017-09-15 14:40:15";"70";"1";"0";;"entry_detail.html";"0";"0";"0";"0";"1";"zinnia/_entry_detail.html"

After a final showdown between Robyn’s McLean&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">Up Crew and Bhav’s Best B’haviour, Robyn’s team took the coveted golden ball. The final ranking&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">was:</span></p><p></p><table id=\"table76343\" class=\"table table-condensed table-hover\">    <thead>        <tr>            <th>Ranking</th>            <th>Team</th>        </tr>    </thead>    <tbody>        <tr>            <td>1</td>            <td>McLean Up Crew (Robyn McLean)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td>2</td>            <td>Best B'haviour (Bhav Virdi)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td>3</td>            <td>Kernel Mustard with a Hockey Stick (Matt Kern)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td>4</td>            <td>A&amp;E Platinum Members (Laurie Mckenzie)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td>5</td>            <td>Aerial Assault (Colin Troll)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td>6</td>            <td>Leeve it to Us (Eimear Lee)</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td>7</td>            <td>Russelling up Goals (Owen Russell)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>And now, a little something from our captains….</p><p></p><h3>Leeave it to Us (White) – Captain Eimear Lee</h3><p>The White team got off to a respectable start with a draw against the eventual winners, Robyn’s&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: initial;\">Greens. A lack of subs on the ladies’ side may be been partly to blame for the subsequent two losses&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">to the Yellows and Reds, but it was all to play for in the last game of the evening against the Oranges&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">who were having a similar run of matches. Dani put two cracking goals past Jason in that game and&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">to everyone’s surprise, Jim also got a sneaky one by. I don’t think anyone knew what was happening&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">but suddenly the ball was in the goal; we’ll take it. A good end to the first evening to finish 3-1 up.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">The second night started off well with some new arrivals to bolster the ranks, but not even Dave&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">Monck's powerful cross-pitch clearances could rustle up a win for us against the Blue and Pink&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">teams. Not to worry, there was some enjoyable hockey played throughout. Time for some Haribo&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">before the 5th/6th playoff. Colin's Oranges were looking a little less tired than the last time we played&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">them, but there was not much sign of the orange #ADL t-shirts sadly; how quickly the fashion world&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">moves. A very entertaining game followed with a disallowed goal for the Whites (there may or may&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">not have been a back stick, eagle-eyes Rosselli) and a nice goal from the Oranges meant that it&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">finished 1-0 to them.</span></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Aerial Assault (Orange) – Captain Colin Troll</h3><p>No need to talk about what happened on the Tuesday night. I think we got a goal at some point, but&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: initial;\">we found ourselves rock bottom of the league table going into match night 2 with the 1st &nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">2nd &nbsp;place still to play. Perhaps that’s exactly where we wanted to be in order to give everyone else a&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">false sense of security? It worked a treat as we beat ‘<b>B’have Bhav’s</b>’ top of the table team 1-0 in our&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">first match and then drew against ‘<b>The Old Kernels Rabble</b>’ after that.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">All that improvement/achievement only meant we still finished 6th , which set up an epic clash&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">against the ‘<b>Leeave the disallowed back-stick goals to us, as this Orange team clearly are the best&nbsp;</b></span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\"><b>team here tonight, how on earth have we drawn these guys in our last game?</b>’ team. We beat&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">them 1-0 (having scored a very nice and very legitimate goal) to ensure we didn’t get the wooden&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">spoon, which I didn’t actually see on the night but I assume that this is now in Eimear’s possession.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">Perhaps she can try stirring stuff with the back side of that spoon and see that that also does not&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">work either!&nbsp;</span></p><p><i><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">[Editor’s note: the coveted (and non-existent) wooden spoon would have gone to the 7th place team,&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">so I’m not sure how either team in the 5th/6th place playoff would have won it!]&nbsp;</span></i></p><p><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">Here’s my team celebrating a great Thursday night of hockey, and forgetting what happened on the&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">Tuesday evening two days before:</span></p><p></p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/IMG-20170907-WA0001.jpg\" style=\"cursor: nw-resize;\"></p><h3>Kernel Mustard with a Hockey Stick (Yellow) – Captain Matt Kern</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Over the course of four games on Tuesday we moved from pitch to pitch, vigorously interrogating&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: initial;\">the opposition, picking holes in their defensive alibis, and parrying their offensive weaponry. We&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">finished the night with a good hall of intel and sitting second in the rankings.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">Thursday didn't go so well. Despite Katie nailing the ball in the right hand netting with a hockey stick&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">we swallowed a &nbsp;few misdirections from the usual suspects (including eventual winners, the McLean&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">Up Crew) and ended up a mustard-coloured smear on the astroturf.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">Anyone up for Risk?</span></p><h3>A&amp;E Platinum Members – Captain Laurie McKenzie</h3><p>The Pink team did rather well considering we had Harriet, new Harry, Harry Chalk and Jack Chalk.&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: initial;\">Passing was confusing to say the least, but we managed to win some games with some great &nbsp;hockey&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">and came a respectable 4th.</span></p><h3>Best B’haviour (Red) – Captain Bhav Virdi</h3><p>Day 1: 3 wins and a draw. We all worked hard and goals were scored in each game except the drawn&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: initial;\">match. The day ended with the Reds ending on top of the table.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">Day 2: We lost our first game and won the next game which meant that we would play in the finals&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">against the Greens! Yeahhhhhh! The finals started positively and Tom scored the opener after 2&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">minutes. The Greens came back strongly and scored 2 goals from PCs. We lost 1-2 in the end but it&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">was a great experience.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">A few positives from this tournament: the teams were new and everyone were playing with others&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">for the first time; however everyone gelled in very quickly, especially encouraged to see that the&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">younger players stepped up and played attacking hockey. This should give us strength &amp; belief to&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">play positively though the 2017-2018 season. Good luck to all.</span></p><h3>Russelling up Goals (Blue) – Captain Owen Russell</h3><p>What is Club Night all about?</p><p>It’s the start of the new season, it’s greeting old friends, it’s meeting the new people to the club and&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: initial;\">showing them what we are all about, it’s about seeing how everyone has spent their summer. It’s</span></p><p>about having fun, running around, not getting injured, getting your eye in ready for the serious&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: initial;\">games. It’s certainly not about beating teams, or scoring goals – oh no, no. That would be wrong,&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">against the spirit of things.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">So in essence the glorious Blue team was the real winner of Club Night IX – More conventional&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">methods of ranking teams might mean that out of the seven teams we ended up just below&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">sixth. But we defy convention and ignore those things like scores.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">I am contractually obliged to actually complete some sort of match report, so here goes… Overall –&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">things didn’t really go well for us; on the first day we lost the first two, but scored a goal, drew the&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">next, lost the last. But we didn’t end up bottom of the table! Bursting with confidence, we started&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">the next day, picked up our other point in the first game, and were flying high. Final game we gave&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">the eventual winners a tough run and a close call but lost to the odd goal in a one goal thriller... but&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">alas bottom of the table was calling and the opportunity of an earlier finish than the others.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">Everyone on the team did fantastically well, massive thanks to all, especially the guys newer to&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">hockey. &nbsp;Always great to see a good number of new faces. We were the real winners, remember&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">that!&nbsp;</span></p><h3>McLean Up Crew (Green) – Captain Robyn McLean</h3><p>Day 1 of Club Night saw the Green team go from strength to strength! With two 0-0 games against&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: initial;\">the Reds and Whites we knew we had to up our game against the Pinks. They had a game plan with&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">strategy and a sub plan; we, well, were winging it. It was a tough one but we prevailed; 2-1. Our final&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">match of the day was against the Oranges. We weren’t taking any prisoners, our team was confident&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">and with some super strikes we got 2 past the keeper to secure the game. Finishing 3rd in the table&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">on the first day we posed a threat for day 2.</span></p><p>After great play on day 2, we managed to get ourselves into the final!! Whaaaat! We were up against&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: initial;\">the Reds who were looking dangerous but we were up to the challenge. Defending hard against</span></p><p>Bhav’s mighty team and although we conceded early in the match we battled on! Determined to&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: initial;\">show them who was boss we manged to find the back of the net twice before the final whistle –&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">WINNERS! Absolutely fantastic teamwork, well done Greens!! #greentogreen</span></p><p></p>";NULL;NULL;"2017-09-08 07:09:01";"68";"1";"0";;"entry_detail.html";"0";"0";"0";"0";"1";"zinnia/_entry_detail.html"

Thanks for organising it, Norwich! It was worth it, eh?</p><p>First a camp must be established. Cue grand assembly of chairs, blankets, food, sticks and smiles.</p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/IMG_0429.JPG\" style=\"\"></p><p>Lovely, all sorted there then. We had all packed waterproofs, warm clothes, and some of us even remembered spare pants, all because it was going to be a washout. Well Kendra and the forecaster were mistaken. The sunshine was glorious, shining down on us as we slotted a lovely three past Thetford in our first game. Notably, our multi-talented Janette braved it in the opposition's 23, Izzy scared off the oppo GK with her strong first strike at the short (job done, 10/10), Eimear pestered at the penalty spot, and Katie decided she is allergic to her own <strike>sweat</strike> <strike>gin</strike> sweat. Izzy's bum got some pitch action. Again. She does love a sit down mid-game, does our Izzy. At least it stopped a ball to the face.</p><p>Next we were up against Norwich 7s. This was one of those games where we really should have practised passing around the back, but some of us got a little obsessed with scoring goals. Six of them. All solidly committed to the backboard with extra tap-ins on the line, just in case (Kendra \"Goal-Thief\" Seed, I hear she's called). Alice made herself welcome in the squad with her goals, and Katie proved to herself she could do it too! Other newbie Jenny managed an even stronger first-shot-off-short: watch out, Iz! Our poor defenders were feeling a little left out by this point, and Emma Saynor had yet to even pretend to be playing.</p><p>Twenty-six minutes of great hockey done, and back to Kendra's super preparation skills.</p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/IMG_0423.JPG\" style=\"\"></p><p>Those were banana, chocolate and cinnamon buns, by the way, and they were delicious, much-needed grub. WHO BROUGHT TERRY'S CHOCOLATE ORANGE?! Terry Gibson, you legend.</p><p>At some point we played another game, against another fearsome opponent, which we definitely won. But I guess all that rain washed away our memories… Kendra wasn't entirely incorrect: we had a brief \"refreshing\" shower just as we were due to pushback for our third game. The majority of both teams ended up huddled under the dugouts, awaiting the hooter and their chance to sprint out, roly-poly, and collect the ball. Those last bits didn't happen, sadly - we'll save the gymnastics for Ely. Meanwhile, whilst three of us were soaking having doggedly braved out the downpour in place on the pitch, the others were appreciably sodden. Brrrr…maybe Naomi should have brought a jumper as well as a ski jacket.</p><p>And finally a long break.</p><p>\"Let's get some hot dogs.\"</p><p>\"My stick is in the middle!\"</p><p>\"Bit of a wait. Never mind, let's order some hot dogs.\"</p><p>\"And make a plastic carrier bag full of our valuables to stop the Norwich tournie thief.\"</p><p>\"Hang on, doesn't putting everything valuable in one bag actually make it easy to grab and go?\" Not when Seed is guarding! And so the keep-the-bag-safer-than-your-tamagotchi game began.</p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/FullSizeRender.jpg\" style=\"\"></p><p>The hot dogs were still cooking, so we played a game with hungry bellies! And a tough team finally broke apart our fluid midfield and tested our defensive line. It's almost like we handed the Dragons a Dragon… They could only get one past us though, and at least Saynor got some kicking action. This action included taking out our dear Lucy B, who seemed to miss the point at which the ball was safely in Emma's kicking reach and continue to dive at it regardless. Very funny from the sidelines, less funny for Lucy's arm skin I fear. Ouch!</p><p>Has anyone seen Katie's stick? Never mind the hot dogs are READY. Mmmmmm. Much needed hangover food, at half two on a beautiful-again Sunday afternoon.</p><p>Ok, chillout time. Zzzzzzzz; tan tan tan; laugh at Katie. Hannah, Lucy and Kath nattered away like they're on Love Island. We all laughed a bit more. Oooh, a free pitch? Let's <strike>practise some hockey</strike> build a human pyramid.</p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/IMG_0440.JPG\" style=\"\"></p><p>And pester the opposition to take a team photo.</p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/Team_photo.jpg\" style=\"\"></p><p>And a few more.</p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/IMG_0437.JPG\" style=\"\"></p><p>Oh, we had to play again didn't we? In the Cup semi-final no less. Ok, up we got - LET'S DO THIS GIRLS. My word, this team was fit. Maybe they didn't just have a nap. Well at least our defenders got their money's worth. Go go go Dani, Hannah, Lucy, Janette! Slight subbing bemusement, apologies Kath! AND IT'S A DRAW! You can't get past the Saynor and her minions. Thank goodness we did actually practise our flicks before the game. Oh, maybe Naomi shouldn't have subbed herself before the whistle. No matter, we had a whole trove of flick superstars for Louisa to choose from. Today, it was down to Kendra, Izzy, Jenny and Saynor. Do we want silverware? Or would we rather just get home at a decent time?</p><p>Kendra took first flick. Beautifully slung low and wide, a little too wide. Up step the opposition and Saynor. IT'S A SAVE! 0-0. Ok, Izzy, you've got this. BOOM! Of course she has. Oh, so do they. It's 1-1 going into the third round of flicks. Wilkommen to the team, Jenny, now take a flick pretty please? Oh, thank god for that. Final score 1-2, out in the semis, which meant we could go home!</p><p>Great effort all round, and not just with the hockey: marvellous foraging and baking, guarding and pyramid making. The L2s know how to occupy themselves on a Sunday it turns out. And Dani has <a href=\"https://splice.gopro.com/v?id=Ve5oby\">master montaging skills</a> (WARNING: gutsy backing track!)</p><p>Sorry no silverware, Jan; not sorry we had time to take in Kendra's childhood home and still get back in time for this ephemeral mist and sunset.</p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/IMG_0454.JPG\" style=\"\"></p>";NULL;"2017-09-18 21:00:00";"2017-09-18 21:02:24";"71";"1";"0";;"entry_detail.html";"0";"0";"0";"0";"1";"zinnia/_entry_detail.html"

For too many years have I watched other captains wander up the front of the stage at the end of season dinner and collect the applause of the club for romping to league success. No more. It is our time, the M2s' moment. Nothing but the league title will do. We are privileged. We are the chosen few. Many are considered but few are chosen. People don’t think anything of us. Nothing. We’re here just to make up the numbers. No one’s going to do it for us. We have to find our own solace — our own drive, our ambition, our own inner strength, because the moment’s arrived for the greatest season of our lives.</p><h3>Ladies 2nds (Louise Warburton, Dani K-Steele)</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.cambridgesouthhockeyclub.co.uk/teams/l2/2016-2017/\"><i>Last Season 4th in Div 4NW(S)</i></a></p><p>The L2s are looking for promotion whilst enjoying the hockey along the way.

That should spice things up a bit. We have also entered the England Hockey Mixed national tournament. Having got knocked out in Round 2 by Surbiton last season I reckon we will probably win the whole competition this year. I'm sure we shall be in attendance at the Ely Weekend, defend our plate at the Saffron Walden Bailey Cup, and enter a few more tournaments at the tail end of the season as well.</p><p>I'm sure everyone in the teams will support their skippers in these plans.

The Girls’ U14 side were hosting St Neots and Shefford &amp;Sandy at Long Road in the opening weekend of England Hockey’s 7-a-sideDevelopment Championship competition.</p><p>With the pitch unavailable until the afternoon, it was1.30pm before fixtures could get underway. South were able to bring a maximumsquad of ten players, with nine outfielders for six positions and a goalkeeper,and enthusiasm to play was such that we could have brought more.</p><p>Cambridge South’s first ever junior representativesassembled at 1pm, ready in their purple club playing T-shirts, dark shorts andskirts and purple socks. Juniors Secretary, Neil, was on hand to distributepin-on shirt numbers and help the keeper with her kit while two players fromour senior ladies’ teams, Dani and Lauren, had come to act as team managers, planningthe formation and organising the substitutions. Club Welfare Officer, Jack, waspresent to do some very important bib-holding.</p><p>Also in attendance were our volunteer umpires, Laurie, Andiand Guy – who had diplomatically suggested that he umpire the game that hisdaughter, Charlotte, was <b>not</b> playingin, more in his own interests in avoiding any wrath from a wrong decision thanthose of impartiality I believe.</p><p>After the downpour at the previous day’s training session, wewere thankfully spared any further soakings on a bright and crisp afternoon.The fixtures got underway with South taking on a very practised Shefford &amp;Sandy side. Their familiarity and cohesion gave them a strong advantage and by half-time,the visitors had built a substantial lead against the debutant Southerners, whowere still working on gelling as a team – a situation exemplified at Shandy’sfirst penalty corner when some confusion about roles meant none of the Southdefenders ran to the injected ball!</p><p>However, improvement was rapid and the second twenty minuteswere a much different affair, with South competing more strongly and giving theShandy keeper some work to do. The visitors did score another couple with someskilful individual play but South were able to reply with their first (ever!)goal, and plenty of encouragement to take away.</p><p>While Shefford &amp; Sandy and St Neots contested the secondmatch, also won by the strong Shandy side, the Cambridge South players took theopportunity for some team practice on the unused half of the pitch. Lauren madean unscheduled and sooner than expected return from her recent injury, and provedthat it is possible to play hockey in leather calf boots, while Dani showed herusual commitment and determination in her tackles – seemingly making only aslight concession to the age of her opponents!</p><p>The final fixture of the afternoon was Cambridge Southagainst St Neots, played with the aid of floodlights under the fading sky. South’sform continued its improvement from their previous game in a well-contested match.Both keepers were called into action and there were some great saves andclearing kicks from the Cambridge stopper. The difference between the teams wasmost apparent in St Neots’s sharper finishing, which saw them gradually build alead, but the last word went to the home team, which broke through the St Neotsdefence to score the final goal of the afternoon.</p><p>Despite not winning, the South players greatly enjoyed theirfirst experience playing together as a team and their very noticeableimprovement over the two fixtures. Thank you to everyone who came along to play,coach, umpire and support. We look forward to more fixtures, and more CambridgeSouth junior teams taking to the field in the future.</p>";NULL;NULL;"2017-11-20 17:04:53";"73";"1";"0";;"entry_detail.html";"0";"0";"0";"0";"1";"zinnia/_entry_detail.html"

As a prior booking meant Long Road was unavailable, we were compelled to travel across town to the Wilberforce Road pitch, carrying a load of goalie kits, bibs, cones, balls, sticks etc. with us.</p><p>With four clubs and four age categories, including a Mixed U8 group, the timetabling was looking very tight if everyone was to play everyone else. Fortunately/unfortunately, City proved to be the only club with a Mixed U8 team and the resulting reduction to three age groups meant that all matches could be comfortably accommodated.</p><p>The conditions on Sunday morning were grey, slightly damp, but not too chilly (for December) when the teams assembled at 10.30, the South players all looking very smart in their club shirts. Jack, Neil and Jonny arrived early to get the goals and pitch markers set up, followed shortly by James. The day opened with the Boys’ U12 7-a-side matches on one half pitch, while theother half was divided into two pitches for the Mixed U10 5 (or 6)-a-side games. Jack, James and Jonny divided the tasks of organising the teams and helping umpire the games between them, while Neil patrolled the pitch with air horn in hand, signalling the start and end of the games to keep to the tight timetable.</p><p>The South Mixed U10 team had a good squad of eight players, four boys and four girls, which were well-used as they played four fifteen minute games back-to-back against City’s two teams as well as March and Wisbech. The play was energetic and competitive, with plenty of dribbling, tackling, passing and even a few goals!</p><p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/IMG_4809.jpg\" style=\"\"><br><i>Boys' U12 (A-Z): Matteo Cicuta, Ben Pullen, Teddy Scotcher, Harry Stewart, Freddie Westmacott, guest player</i></p><p>On the other side of the pitch, the Boys’ U12 team was somewhat understrength with only five players available. Fortunately, we were able to borrow a spare player and goalkeeper from the other teams to complete the side. The matches, against more experienced teams, were a steep learning curve for the South debutants but some good passages of play and individual skills were demonstrated by all of the players. Three games of twenty minutes without any substitutes was a challenge, but fortunately the team had a game off between each fixture to rest and recover.</p><p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/IMG_4811.jpg\" style=\"\"><br><i>Girls' U12 (A-Z): Matilda Bruce, Isla Chapman, Amelia Dale, Helen Eriksson, Isla Kotzenberg, Anna Lindon, Pippa Lindon, Florence Nickels</i></p><p>With the completion of the Boys’ U12 and Mixed U10 fixtures, the second half of the event was turned over to the Girls’ U12s, both half pitches being in use for the 7-a-side matches. The five teams, including two from Cambridge City, played each other in fifteen minute games. Dani and Lauren arrived to reprise their management partnership from the Girls' U14s' debut, while South’s squad of eight, although probably still the smallest there, allowed the luxury of a substitute. As with the boys’ side, having never played a game together before the South team took its time to find its feet, but the willingness and effort was never in doubt and the team improved noticeably from match to match.</p><p>For the teams’ first ever matches, there was plenty to take encouragement from. All teams showed marked improvement over their fixtures as they began to get to grips with playing together, and undoubtedly will be stronger in future games for the experience. With each team having an hour of match time, we definitely hope to welcome more players to share the running in future! Well done everyone though, on a great debut.</p>";NULL;NULL;"2017-12-08 13:37:21";"74";"1";"0";;"entry_detail.html";"1";"0";"0";"0";"1";"zinnia/_entry_detail.html"

Both sides tired in the heat and South nearly brought it home but the final whistle went slightly too soon as our forwards were bearing down on goal for one last try.</p><p>Highlights included:</p><ul><li><p>Helena marking one of their stronger players out of the game.</p></li><li><p>Juliette injuring her hand diving in to try and deflect it pass the keeper, then playing on to try and get the winner.</p></li><li><p>Amelia not giving up and getting a goal to cancel out Peterborough's early lead.</p></li><li><p>Freddie driving out of defence to try and get a winner in the final minutes</p></li><li><p>Teddy looking like he had been for a swim when he finally took the keeping kit off.</p></li></ul><p>Over the three games it was great to see the passing and moving learnt in Coach Colin's sessions demonstrated, and the energy to burst forward to try to score. Positional play was something maybe even the Men's 1st team could learn from, and everyone worked hard to get back the ball each time possession was lost. A big ‘well done’ to all those who played but a special mention to our goalkeeper, Teddy, who not only played for our team but lent his skills to a team who did not have a keeper of their own, playing four games back to back on what must have been the hottest day of the year so far.</p><p><u>Girls' U14s: Wisbech 6 – 0 Cambridge South</u></p><p>Meanwhile, the Girls’ U14s had a brutally early start for their England Hockey Tier 3 Development Championship game up in Wisbech. Neil had foolishly agreed to a 10am push back, forgetting that the clock change effectively made that 9am, which meant an ‘8.30am’ meet at the pitch after a ‘7.15am’ departure from Cambridge, with in turn a ‘6.30am’ get-up on a Sunday morning!</p><p>Fortunately, a sunny spring-like morning lifted everyone’s spirits. Coaches Neil and Mariano explained the new 1-2-2-1 formation to the team – a holding playmaker behind two central midfielders, with two wider players shuttling up and down the flanks to aid the defence or support the striker up top.</p><p>After a short warm-up, the game got underway. Wisbech quickly showed themselves to be a practiced and well-organised side, their good linking play putting pressure on the visitors. Charlotte, in the holding role, was dealing with most of what came her way though, and Isla made several saves when attacks did get through. South threatened with a few breaks of their own but eventually the home side found a way past South’s defence and were two ahead at half time.</p><p>With four substitutes rolling every few minutes, at the break the discussion was of the need to keep the team’s shape and positions. The second period showed some good passages of play from both teams. Wisbech got more into their groove, with some incisive attacks enabling them to add to their score. For South, Hannah was putting in an excellent performance in midfield, demonstrating strong tackling and passing, while Alicia made some fantastic runs and dribbles towards the Wisbech D. Sam, Eloise, Katy, Emma, Scarlet, Zara and Cleo all worked hard against a strong opposition, but a couple of late goals, including one on the final whistle, saw the game finish 6-0 to the hosts.</p><p>Despite some late goals giving a gloss to the score, there was much to be positive about in South’s performance. Everyone worked hard as a team, and all the players showed passages of skilful play. The next step will be to join these up into a more cohesive collective performance, which will come with time and experience as a team, and to remember to keep pressing the opposition and competing for the ball when play does break down. We look forward to the final games of the season, with fixtures against Cambridge City and St Neots at Wilberforce Road in May.</p>";NULL;NULL;"2018-03-27 09:34:52";"75";"1";"0";;"entry_detail.html";"0";"0";"0";"0";"1";"zinnia/_entry_detail.html"

For one thing, it was during the day. The weather cooperated andinstead of forecast grey skies, there was blazing sunshine. The result ofthis was many sweaty games and a number of pink faces at the annual dinner.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">Thanks to everyone for signing up tomake this possible. We had over 70 people participating, including 5 goaliesand our very own Jack Chalk to keep the score and generally make things run ontime.

But, as I always say, if you can'tstand the heat, get out of Simon Kitchen. Things started swimmingly, withEimear banging in a couple of early goals and Jimmy Whizz practising hispenalty shuffles. In our solitary win, Wizard was much to the fore, as was theperceptive defensive play&nbsp;of&nbsp;Laurie and Laura. Matt K's early departure saw us finish a little short ofnumbers and, by extension, energy. Looking back, perhaps we should have putless effort into our Flying V starts and flamboyant goal celebrations and savedsome energy for the last game, which saw us being flattened by Rosselli'srampant mob. The undoubted highlight of our day came midway through the midwaygame against the Red Team. Dave Monck was casually ambling through midfield,looking for all the world like a modern day vegetarian dinosaur that thoughtits predators long-since extinct, before he was casually flattened by ahurtling Hannah Kenyon. It was brutal.</p><p><b style=\"background-color: initial;\">Yellow Team – The Emmentalists, Captain Andi Caddy</b><br></p><p>The Emmentalists consisting of AliEdge, Alex Pashley, Alice Wright, Catriona West, Liz Dunsby, Jason James, MeganMylrea and captained by Andi C were in high spirits leading into the day'sfixtures. Captain Caddy had gone as far as laminating Hannah Kenyon’s match daypack in an effort to look ‘Pro’ only to surrender them to the strangely under-prepared Jack Chalk who appeared to be assisting in running the event. After ashort huddle and team talk consisting of such inspirational words as ‘just playwhere you want’ and ‘sub when you’re tired’ the Emmentalists launched into ClubDay X with enthusiasm and vigour, as befits any Cambridge South Team!</p><p>There were some periods of greatpassing hockey displayed by the Emmentalists with great distribution from JJwho was ably supported by the resolute Megan. There was a fear that the heatwould cause the team’s game to slow down to that of fondue-like consistency butthis was not to happen! Our triple-A heroes (Alex, Ali &amp; Alice) threatenedopposition teams constantly with their instinctive stick skills and intelligentrunning patterns, resulting in goals of such quality that would make PepGuardiola jealous. This of course could not have been achieved without theselfless support given by Liz Dunsby who was unfortunate not to score andCatriona West&nbsp;<u>who played everyminute of every game</u>.</p><p>Unfortunately the powers that beconspired against us, leading to a final result for the Emmentalists of secondfrom bottom. Not quite wooden spoon but everyone had a great time nonetheless!Thanks to everyone for making Club Day X a great event!</p><p>MOMs – All the Goalkeepers forgetting toasted for a good 2 hours</p><p>LOM – Captain Caddy for viciouslyshoulder barging a teenage girl in the D (sorry Zara!) and conceding thesubsequent penalty shuffle from which she duly scored.</p><p><b style=\"background-color: initial;\">Red Team – Grate Expectations,Captain Katherine Gibson</b><br></p><p>What we lacked in goals we made up for in spirit. Each gamewas fought with vigour and determination. The blazing heat was no match for thereds after three games straight at the start. I feel we did well to come third(from last). Sadly, I have absolutely no clue what the scores were for any ofour matches, except that we beat the yellows and drew a few times. But true champions don't count goals, and there was some great play across the teamwith flowing passes and skillz so silky I'll spell it with a 'z' .&nbsp; Eachgame was close, with the red team narrowly missing victory. Overall a solideffort by everyone and hopefully everyone had fun!&nbsp;</p><p><b style=\"background-color: initial;\">Purple Team – Curds of Prey,Captain Owen Harrison</b><br></p><p>A quirky purpleteam started with a win against the reds before battling hard in twowell-fought draws against whites and blues. Then purples faced a stubborn greenteam who were kept alive multiple times by South's very own David De Gea (AKAJason Mann). A late winner for purples kept the title hopes alive! Next ayellow team who started brightly by taking the lead; purples were down but notout and a comeback was on the cards. Two well-worked goals proved to be enoughto take the points.</p><p>Onegame was left, and purples knew victory could put them in title contention.After falling four goals behind, the purples needed to better the Liverpool of2005 to enter eternal glory. With tired legs and sun-burnt faces, purples couldnot muster a win and finished a respectable mid-table.</p><p>Special mention toHannah and Ollie for making Club Day possible!</p><p><b style=\"background-color: initial;\">Green Team - Looking Gouda,Captain Lauren Brown</b><br></p><p>So when Club Lady Kenyon asked me to write ashort paragraph on Looking Gouda’s Club Day, it seemed a simple task.Unfortunately a combination of a slightly ropey memory and the passing ofseveral days, including Annual Dinner, means recollections of Saturday are alittle hazy. So here’s my take on what I think might have happened. All factsunverified.</p><p>While team balance was a regular topic ofdiscussion for the day, for the green team this was focused around our 1 GK, 1defender, 3 mid-fielders, 4 attackers make-up. Who needs defenders anyway?!Unfortunately this didn’t work out, losing to the Blue team in our first game(it feels like I should use the cheese-related team names, but if the prize-giving tells us anything it’s that no one pays attention to this and as aresult no-one knows what’s going on!). Victories against the Pink (crackinggoal by Alice!), White and Yellow teams followed (and a couple more defeats)resulting in us definitely finishing 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;(or maybe 4<sup>th</sup>?).</p><p>Special mention to Zara for scoring the winninggoal with a shuffle against the yellow team, George for being the only member ofthe team to be sent off for tardy stick collection and apologies to anyonewhose short corner routines were distracted by our team mascot entering thepitch!</p><p><b style=\"background-color: initial;\">Blue Team - The Milky Whey,Captain Amalia Thomas</b><br></p><p>It waswarm, it was sunny, and there was hockey. The Milky Whey’s game was mostlyfriendly, but our defence took their job very seriously, and both Tom Rosselliand Jan Brynjolffssen got green cards for dangerous play in the D. Whetherbecause that intimidated the opposition enough, or because of their amazingskills, thanks to our strong defence made up of Tom, Jan and Nicky Simler weonly conceded goals in short corners.</p><p>On theother end of the pitch, Annie Quantrill, James Matthews, Rebecca Frith andAmalia Thomas ran tirelessly despite the heat to get the ball to the forwardsAndy Thomas and Sven Lake. With only two games left, Shin Kim arrived only tobe shared with Grate Expectations (the red team) in the spirit of Club Day(Hannah said so). But both with and without him our front line was just assuccessful as the defence and managed to equal every goal conceded, and by theend of the day we counted four draws and two wins, gaining us second placeoverall.</p><p>We cameclose to winning the coveted golden ball and assorted chocolates but nevermind... it had been a day of perfect weather and friendly hockey, and we wereall looking forward to the annual dinner in the evening; all in all a greatClub Day!</p><p><b style=\"background-color: initial;\">Pink Team – R &amp;Brie, Captain MC Hazzardous</b><br></p><p>All we do is Win Win Win no matterwhat (apart from drawing one and losing one). The R &amp; Bries got off to asolid start, keeping a clean sheet in their first 2 games. Sadly the heat ofthe sun got to the best of us in our first back-to-back game where we narrowlylost our only game of the day. The team was feeling the heat but managed toscrape together a win before a double game break to put ourselves back incontention for the title.</p><p>We knew motivation was low and all wewanted was an ice cream but staying true to our team name we got the mix tapeout and pumped ourselves up through the power of music (mainly Seal, Kiss froma Rose). Mandatory huddle and sticks-in at the start of each match helped rallythe team to a 5-0 victory over 'Edam Good Time' followed by a 4-0 victory over‘Curds of Prey’.</p><p>Thanks to the final two victories R&amp; Brie were crowned winners of the tournament! A big shout-out to the teamfor working hard through the heat and making it a great day for all.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>And finally, congratulations to our annual Club Daypoetry award winner.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">My team was in pink<br></span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">I'm not scared of the sunshine<br></span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">Now my face is pink</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">-</span><i style=\"background-color: initial;\">Tom Rosselli, Class M1</i></p><br><p></p>";NULL;NULL;"2018-04-26 22:19:15";"76";"1";"0";;"entry_detail.html";"1";"0";"0";"0";"1";"zinnia/_entry_detail.html"

Owen met us in London and held down the fort until we arrived. He managed to rearrange our first game so that we wouldn’t miss it, but we were running so late that our second game started with only Owen on the pitch. We lost the first (second) game 3-0 but considering it was a one-man team plus a borrowed goalie for half of the game, it wasn’t a bad result. The following games went much better; we managed to actually get a full team on the pitch and won 6-2, 1-0 and 3-0.</p><p>We broke for lunch and George got involved in the obstacle course, which involved an alternative version of apple bobbing, a lovely pink wig, an inflatable flamingo and a slip and slide.</p><p>The afternoon brought the second round of pool matches and then the finals.

The Colin-less TFI Thursday drew with St Ives in a 3-3 tussle.</p><p>The Plate saw Lauren’s Stoners &amp; Loaners form a potent combination to put 5 past TTPish in the battle of the tech companies. Joe’s Love Island Rejects surrendered their early lead and then had their chestnuts hauled out of the fire by some blinding saves from kicking back JJ before a late resurgence sealed the points. There was controversy in a very tight game between Queens’ Greatest Hits &amp; Stevenson’s Rockets, as a Rocket from Alex P smacked kicking back Neil point-blank in his Stevensons before Elaine tapped the loose ball home, only for it to be later ruled out (by Neil) for cruel and unusual play.</p><p>The first league tables are attached. A few quick match reports from our captains, too:</p><p><u>Love Island Rejects</u><br>It’s a short match report from the villa this week for us: ‘Too much Dick Sand for the Red Team as the Love Island Rejects Mugg them off. 5-3.’</p><p><u>Banana Hammocks</u><br>The P-Flicks &amp; Chill squad posed a difficult first game for the Banana Hammocks, and this manifested itself early on when we conceded a (debatable) goal. We soldiered on without complaint (Alice &amp; Robyn may need anger management counselling), Dani making some vital tackles on the right and Lucy grafting on the left, offering good distribution. Good movement and passing from Alice and Ollie led to a great goal, unfortunately our only one, not for want of trying though. Lots of running from Hannah and Robyn was essential due to regular opposition counters, Samuel faffed in the middle (pass Sam, pass) while Douglas and Matt produced solid performances. Not to mention Lydia, who’s outstanding saves kept us in the game.

You could barely get a cigarette paper between TFI Thursday and Miracle Whip, Colin’s orange wizards edging it 1-0.</p><p>Over in the Plate, Love Island Rejects continued their storming start to the competition, Stoning the Loaners 7-2 despite going behind after only 15 seconds. Queens’ Greatest Hits, although missing the hitting power of the Monckosaurus up front, had pace to burn with Larks, Pip &amp; Keishi tearing up the pitch, finishing 5-2 winners against the Edge-Hogs. TTPish had brought their A-team this week and were too strong for Stevenson’s Rockets in the final match, a 6-1 win for Jan’s mob including a p-flick (that looked a bit like a p-hit?) from the captain.</p><p>After round 2 then, the Cup is tighter than a duck’s whatsit with just 1 point between the top 5 teams. The Plate is almost as close, Joe’s pack chilling by their villa pool at the top of the table. 3 more rounds to go.</p><p>This week’s match report is from Colin:</p><p><u>TFI Thursday</u><br>The TFI Thursday crew sit nicely at the top of the Cup league table after a quality team effort, stealing all 3-0 points from arguably the better side that was Amalia’s Miracle Whip. The first half was close but midway through a great bit of passing lead to a goal mouth scramble that was so complicated I can’t remember who scored (it was either Dom or Chris, let’s go with Dom). The second half was tense throughout and Miracle Whip played some quality hockey and to be fair got a lot of shots on target, but goalie Jason was having none of it and withstood whatever came his way. TFI had some great passing moves and managed to hold out (mainly due to Roisin’s 10 out of 10 defensive performance as well as Jason in goal) for the 1-0 win.</p><p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/TFI%20Thursday.jpg\" style=\"\"><br><i>The illustrious/illuminous TFI crew</i></p><p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/Banana%20Hammocks.jpg\" style=\"\"><br><i>B-Hammocks after smashing it</i></p><p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/Summer%207s%20week%202.png\" style=\"\"></p>";NULL;NULL;"2018-06-08 13:52:58";"80";"1";"0";;"entry_detail.html";"0";"0";"0";"0";"1";"zinnia/_entry_detail.html"

Some may remember Joe’s season as captain of the M4s, when he left his hitherto-unbeaten side in the hands of vice-captain Boris for a week only for the team to concede 4 goals in 15 minutes without reply in a derby defeat to Nomads (score in the return fixture - captained by Joe - 5-0 to South).</p><p>Well, this week Joe’s table-topping Love Islanders were up against their closest title challengers, Queens’ Greatest Hits. Joe wasn’t the only absentee and, as befits their name, the team were looking rather (de)nuded, forced to ring the changes with a roster of ringers. Despite competing gallantly and led by stand-in captain JJ (no Boris Lossy, he), without the inspired generalship of their absent leader Neil’s green machine provided too much and a 5-1 win jumps QGH to the top of the Plate table with 1 round to go.</p><p>It’s far from over though, as QGH face a tricky tie against a hot-and-cold TTPish side. 2-0 winners vs the Edge-Hogs this week, which version of Jan’s seemingly ever-changing roster will turn up for the final round? A win in the first fixture of the evening will give QGH the title, a draw or defeat will leave them anxiously awaiting the result of the late tie between the Rejects and the winners of a close 4-3 tussle with 'Stoners &amp; Loaners this week, Stevenson’s Rockets.</p><p>On the other side of the net the Cup is also building towards a climactic frenzy. Victories for Miracle Whip and Banana Hammocks keep both teams level on points at the top but the Whip's 9-5 goalfest against St Ives 2 edges Amalia’s side above the Bananas on goals scored, after Robyn’s crew had only a 3 goal margin in a 5-2 win against St Ives 1. The title is now between these two teams as, in a masterpiece of clairvoyant scheduling, they play each other in the very last match of the competition in 2 weeks’ time. Robyn v Amalia, Sam v Morgan, Scott v Shin, Alice v um…Alice - there are giant match-ups all over the park.</p><p>While St Ives 1s’ hopes of retaining their title foundered on the bitter rocks of defeat, P-Flicks &amp; Chill’s win against TFI Thursday (in the inverse of Love Island, apparently doing worse with the return of their captain Colin) leapt Harry’s side above both teams into 3rd in the table. Ahead by 10 points of GD from St Ives 1, surely any kind of win against St Ives 2 will see them hold off the current champions, no matter what St Ives 1 do against TFI Thursday.</p><p>No tournament next week, as it’s England v Belgium, so we’re all back in 2 weeks' time for celebrations, commiserations, big brand new silver (plated) trophies and, of course, chocolate medals for everyone.</p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/Summer%207s%20week%204.png\"></p>";NULL;NULL;"2018-06-22 14:47:41";"82";"1";"0";;"entry_detail.html";"0";"0";"0";"0";"1";"zinnia/_entry_detail.html"

No, not England’s World Cup campaign, which for once is lasting longer than a bowl of strawberries at Wimbledon, but this years South Summer 7s mixed tournament.</p><p>The evening opened with the Plate leaders, Queens’ Greatest Hits, taking on mid-table TTPish. A win would seal the title, anything else would leave QGH biting their nails on the result of Joe’s Love Island Rejects in the last match of the evening. Generous-spirited as ever, Neil’s team selflessly extended the tournament excitement to the final game by losing 3-2 to Jan’s side, whose wildly-fluctuating personnel and form had them bring a strong line-up along this week. Damn them! The 8.25 game then saw Laura’s red Edge-Hogs pick up their second win of the tournament and consign the ‘Stoners &amp; Loaners to the wooden spoon position.</p><p>Over in the Cup, Colin’s TFI Thursday played out an epic 6-6 draw with St Ives 1 before Harry’s P-Flicks &amp; Chill saw off St Ives 2 3-0 to join Miracle Whip and Banana Hammocks on 9 points at the top of the table. With those two teams playing the final game though, one of them was guaranteed to take the title.</p><p>And so both competitions came down to the final match on the final night. In the Plate, Love Island’s confidence was only slightly lessened by learning that Neil would be one of the umpires in their game…just one of those funny coincidences of scheduling! Confidence diminished further though when, despite missing a goalkeeper for the first 10 minutes and having only 6 players on the pitch, Stevenson’s Rockets stormed forward, pressuring the yellow D and ultimately taking the lead. Needing a win to take the title from QGH, Love Island pressed back and equalised after half time. The match was on a knife edge and the next goal would surely prove decisive; a resurgence from the whites saw them regain the lead before a late goal sealed a 3-1 win for Emily’s side. While the white team celebrated their victory, the remaining greens on the sidelines celebrated even more as their slender 1 point lead was preserved to claim the Plate trophy. So the question of which of QGH or Love Island Rejects would win their final game had been settled: neither of them!</p><p>The Cup final, meanwhile, was proving even more epic. In a game that see-sawed back and forth, Amalia’s Miracle Whip found themselves behind and being overhauled at the top of the table by Robyn’s Banana Hammocks, with their cunning tactic to confuse their opponents by playing in blue instead of yellow this week (apparently as the midges love our fluoro-yellow bibs). Alice (the yellow/blue one) scored an absolute worldie, hitting a ball coming to her off the deck at high speed first time in the air to practically burst the net. It wasn’t enough though, as the white team turned it around to edge the match and the tournament with a 4-3 win. Which meant that, at the end of an evening of exciting hockey, all 12 teams stayed in exactly the same league positions as they’d started the night in!</p><p>There only remained to hand out gold medals to all the players (chocolate and surprisingly unmelted) and present the trophies and magnums of bubbly to the winning captains, Amalia and…ahem…me! Fizz was sprayed, toasts were drunk from the cup - and the saucer - of victory and celebratory photos were taken, before the crowds dispersed after another great month of summer competition.</p><p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/QGH%20Plate%20Champions.jpeg\" style=\"\"><br><i>The triumphant Plate champions - Alex, Emma, Neil, Simon &amp; Steph</i></p><p><img src=\"https://cshc.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/blog/Summer%207s%20final%20week.png\" style=\"\"></p>";NULL;NULL;"2018-07-06 14:57:59";"83";"1";"0";;"entry_detail.html";"1";"0";"0";"0";"1";"zinnia/_entry_detail.html"
